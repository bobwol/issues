        <p>December 18th 2015. More than a year away; but somehow, rather, inevitably, this is the date that has been plastered across the internet for months already – been muttered on the tongues of children and adults alike, as a diminishing, albeit devoted fanbase prepares for a resurrection; a second coming of what many consider the greatest science-fiction franchise to have ever graced our screens, and lives in general. Indeed, while the few sardonic critics disparagingly cast aspersions upon it, the majority of us rejoiced – marvelled at a revelation that at first felt like it couldn&#39;t be true.</p>

<p>But then another piece of news hit us. Perhaps the most provocative piece of news in recent movie history; indeed, just one word - which in almost any other circumstance would likely have had a positive impact. Disney.</p>

<p>For those of you readers who don’t know, or haven’t worked it out yet, it was in fact Walt Disney Pictures who revealed that a new Star Wars film was in the making, and who instantly cast doubt and anxiety over the legacy of the cult classic. Were we going to see Princess Leia leading our beloved Han and Chewbacca on a merry escapade across a newfound fairy-tale kingdom whilst whistling songs of love and the promise of redemption; a stereotypically Disney-esque notion?</p>

<p>Indeed, in saying the word &quot;Disney&quot;, perhaps one of the first images you might form is of a giant castle in the midst of Florida; 5 year old kids frolicking around a giant, 7-foot tall Princess Elsa; masses of artificial snow being propelled around by a huge turbine, and a set of speakers blurting out a song, asking you to help the Princess build a companion set in snow.</p>

<p>Contrast that to the dark, eeriness of the swamps of Dagobah (Yoda’s home planet); a murky wasteland with a hostile atmosphere: the complete antithesis of what Disney represents. The two just simply don’t go together; although each fantastic in their own right, should they really be mentioned in the same breadth?</p>

<p><strong>Pro – More Star Wars films:</strong> Given the choice, why wouldn’t we want to know what has happened to our beloved characters in all this time?</p>

<p><strong>Con – More Star Wars films:</strong>   If they’re anything like the recent “Clone Wars” series (4.2/10 on Rotten Tomatoes), disaster is looming.</p>

<p><strong>Con – Jar Jar Binks:</strong> The third most hated movie character of all time, in a recent magazine poll (after Joffrey and Cersei from Game of Thrones), will now be in shops and amusement parks; not the most hotly anticipated thing.</p>

<p><strong>Pro – Jar Jar Binks:</strong> Perhaps we’ll finally get to see a death scene?</p>

<p><strong>Con – Star Wars comics:</strong>   For the much more devoted fanbase, the new films could destroy the Star Wars Expanded Universe, the officially licensed fan-fiction series created by George Lucas. There’s no possible way Disney will either want to, or be able to replicate it.</p>

<p><strong>Pro – The Marvel franchise:</strong>   Disney purchased Marvel Entertainment Inc. for roughly $4.5bn in 2009. If movies like “The Avengers” and “Guardians of the Galaxy” are anything to go by, it shows that Disney understand how to handle a pre-existing fanbase.</p>

<p><strong>Con – Songs:</strong>  As touched on already, many believe that Disney will make the film much more child oriented. Essentially, that means songs; and if they sing “Darth Vader”, there will likely be a riot.</p>

<p><strong>Pro – New/Fresh ideas:</strong>    Primarily coming through new director JJ Abrahams, and his involvement in the Star Trek franchise, perhaps we can expect newer, more original ideas.</p>

<p>In short, there are many possibilities and directions that the new film will go. And indeed, in a year’s time, there’s no doubt that we’ll all flock to see it; new and old fans alike. Whatever happens, though, is anybody’s guess. While the general consensus is that it’s a bad idea, similarly, many of us are quietly, anxiously hoping to be proved wrong.</p>
