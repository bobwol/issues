        <p>There was a time when 50 cent was arguably the biggest name in the hip-hop/rap scene. The rappers name was universally known, and respected (and maybe feared), as opposed to nowadays where most teens will think of him as a relic of a past era.</p>

<p>After the release of his 2003 debut studio album Get Rich or Die Tryin, which featured the likes of well-known rapper Eminem, and produced by Dr Dre among others, the whole world was fiending for more of the slick young emcee. The album went 6xPlatinum in the United States, and Triple Platinum in the UK, showing how it appealed to a universal audience; Fifty’s ‘homies’ would be eager to ‘represent’, whilst upper middle class members of the Caucasian community, would enjoy listening to the rapper in their German made automobiles somehow feeling connected to the topics of the music. Popular songs in the album such as ‘In da Club’ appealed to a very wide audience successfully, and are still popular today, but 50 also kept his street rep with songs such as ‘Many Men’, and ‘U not like me’, which are more serious songs and highlight the problems faced by the rapper in the environment he grew up in. There was something about the young upstart that made the people love him- his smooth delivery of words, hard-ass lyrics, the confident and invincible persona he employed to great effect- for the first time in a long time in the rap scene there was a truly genuine figure who took the world by storm.</p>

<p>For at least three years after the release of his debut album, 50 dominated the music scene with his posy G-Unit which was composed of childhood comrades Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, and new southern swagger recruit Young Buck. It was with this group that he demolished other rappers in the game such as: Rick Ross, Mobb Deep, Nas, the LOX, and Ja Rule to name a few. He revealed to the world that Rick Ross used to be a parole officer and that Ja Rule was homosexual, a warning to any other rapper who wanted to beef with him. A large chunk of 50s wealth didn’t actually come from rap, but surprisingly from a successful Vitamin Water investment, which didn&#39;t harm his image of a- as he put it P.I.M.P., as it landed around 150 million dollars, bringing his net worth up to a jaw dropping 270 million dollars.</p>

<p>When the rapper had been on top for so long and it seemed as if nothing could bring him down, it all started to fall apart. The same characteristics, which had made him famous led to his downfall: his volatile alpha male personality, and zero tolerance attitude to disrespect and laziness within his squad wreaked havoc among the unit. The first to go was the newest acquisition the Game, who had reached unbelievable fame in the unit, with the single Hate it or Love it reaching number one on the US Hot Rap Songs billboard, and being nominated for a Grammy. Fifty threw him out reportedly for his cockiness and lack of loyalty. He also revealed the Game used to be a male stripper, which as you can imagine put a huge dent in his tough persona. Young Buck was the next to depart, after being arrested for gun charges (a shocker with songs such as ‘Bang Bang’ and ‘Guns Go Bang’), which caused frustration with Fifty who had recently loaned the rapper a large sum of money. Tensions between 50 and Lloyd Banks now mounted because of the rappers apparent laziness, and he eventually left, followed by Tony Yayo who was arrested for drug charges (Yayo= cocaine; his name literally means Tony Cocaine), then immediately after his release from prison released a single called So Seductive. What the hell was he doing in there? After this disastrous series of events, the Unit was left in tatters, and 50s popularity began to fall rapidly. His next two albums Curtis (2007) and Before I Self Destruct (2009) sold a combined 4 million copies, compared to Get Rich or Die Tryin, which sold 12 million copies. 50 now began to delve into different areas of making money, such as headphones, movies and TV, and it seemed as if his music career was over.</p>

<p>This year&#39;s Hot 97 Summer Jam, however, saw a monumental moment for all 50 cent and G-Unit fans. The group had been disbanded for over 6 years, and even the most optimistic of fans had lost hope in any kind of reconciliation, but at the concert they shocked the world by performing several hits together. Shortly after the concert, they began releasing freely downloadable singles, which were remixes of popular songs, and they were extremely popular. The most popular of these singles, which I strongly recommend, is a remix of Drake&#39;s 0-100, called Real Quick, and a remix of HS87&#39;s Grindin My Whole Life, called Nah I&#39;m Talking Bout, both of which received significantly more views on YouTube than the originals, showing the overwhelming support for the reunion. These free releases were also great publicity for their upcoming album, which they announced to be released in November. The EP they recently released, called The Beauty of Independence, evoked pleasant memories of G-Units first two albums and was ranked a respectable 17 on the Billboard200 chart, being just a taste of what is to come. I highly recommend checking the EP out, and advise listening to G-Units new album coming next month called &#39;The Beast Is G-Unit&#39;.</p>
