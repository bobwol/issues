        <p>James Bond will be back. After the financial and critical success of 2012’s Skyfall, the question is where does it go next? With production already underway and filming to begin this December, little has been revealed about the plot or the villains lying in-store for the secret agent, but it seems as if most of the supporting cast from Skyfall have signed on for another Bond flick: Sam Mendes directs once again, Moneypenny and Q are returning, having been re-introduced in the last movie, and Ralph Fiennes breathes new life into the character of M. Let’s just hope that that is all it replicates from Skyfall.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to suggest that the last film was anything bad - on the contrary, it vastly improved upon the overly action-filled Quantum of Solace - but it just lacked that essential James Bond feel. Its plot was put to the side in order to focus on the characterisation of the cast and the ending felt slightly disappointing and anti-climactic. What we need now from the new film is a strong plot to carry it forward and it to pit 007 against a physical villain. Javier Bardem’s Silva captured the mental side of the Bond villain to a tee, but it often felt like he was on the outside, getting other people to do his dirty work for him, whereas a classic close quarters fist to fist combat would have worked much better. Casting calls for a 6’2”+ henchman for the new movie already suggest that the producers are on the right track.</p>

<p>As for the primary villain, rumours have been circulating about Chiwetel Ejiofor, of 12 Years A Slave fame, being cast and this would be a coup for the Bond producers. Some may doubt that he has the credentials to play the baddie, but you only have to look for proof in the space opera epic Serenity. In this, he plays a ruthless and deadly charismatic operative and quite possibly has the coolest method of killing someone since Uma Thurman’s five point palm exploding heart technique in Kill Bill 2 - a nerve pinch to the lower back, causing the victim to freeze and then gently topple on a carefully positioned ceremonial sword. His final fight scene also confirms that he has the physical presence to take on Daniel Craig’s brutish 007. Ejiofor&#39;s Englishness might also hint at the continuation of themes seen in Skyfall, arguably the most British film of the entire series with its attacks on MI6&#39;s London headquarters and its finale in the Scottish Highlands. But in reality, this is an actor with a talent for accents that would allow him to play a wide range of nationalities.</p>

<p>What of the other ingredients needed for a top-quality Bond motion picture? Well, a strong supporting female is much needed, which was undeniably lacking in Skyfall (it always felt a bit strange watching Bond seduce Severine, who was sold into sex slavery), and reports suggest that both a Brit and a Scandinavian actress are being sought for, with Birgitte Hjort Sørensen from the outstanding Scandi drama Borgen as a frontrunner. An international setting would also be a comforting change from the grounding of James Bond in London and the Scottish Highlands and it may follow the suit of older Bond films, which used Russians as the main villains in front of the backdrop of the Cold War; now the Arab Spring region may be used as a suitable place for James Bond to encounter trouble.</p>

<p>Continuing on from this, a greater connection to the past James Bond films would be an improvement; an establishment of previous characters and themes looks likely, with Q and Moneypenny already brought back in Skyfall. Who wouldn’t want the return of Jaws, Oddjob or even Blofeld and his sinister organisation SPECTRE (Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion - always one for subtlety)? Overall, if rumours turn out to be true, then Bond 24 has the makings of a classic Bond film - a physical and charismatic villain, a strong supporting cast carried on from Skyfall and an association with the Bonds of old. Maybe 007 might be killed off once and for all. Will that happen in Bond 24? Probably not, but we can certainly expect a sequel to match and beat the standard set by Skyfall.</p>
