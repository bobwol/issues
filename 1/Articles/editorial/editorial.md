'No' seems to be a very popular word at the moment. 'No' to independence, 'No' to privacy on School Wifi, and, most importantly, 'No' to paper. The brainchild of our ever dependable and wise co-ordinator, Mr Larlham, this edition sees Black and White step further into the digital revolution, now featuring on the App Store. As you swipe, click or tap through this issue, I am sure you will feel a palpable sense of innovation, or advancement.

In accordance with Reverend Blackstone, we have followed the ideology of 'Questioning. Questioning. Questioning. Constant relentless questioning' in this issue. US Patriot Tyler Jackson questions whether anyone else can really fulfill the role of America as the World Police, while Adam Rachman implores him to consider the considerably growing role of China in geopolitics.

Our focus however, is not solely on the events with the most media coverage. The MLS emerges and shows us all where the future of football lies in the Sport Section, while Zaire’s dictator Mobutu Sese Seko will be pleased to hear that he makes an appearance in this prestigious magazine, albeit it being in the form of a fully deserved hounding from James Cole for both this terrible economic management and, more importantly, horrific dress sense. Indeed, fashion becomes a more serious part of this edition, with Albert Meek’s first of a kind article on LFW, and with our good friend Erasmus giving us all a helping hand with our dress sense. Speaking of helping hands, our School Life sections features endless advice on how to cope with one’s St Paul’s career, notably with the ‘Hilariously Bad School Reports’ hopefully showing our readers what not to aim for in end of terms reviews.

We hope you enjoy these articles and, moreover, this groundbreaking new format and, which will see a lot more issues being published yearly.
