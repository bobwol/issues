#### To what extent was David Moyes’ reign at Manchester United doomed to fail? (10)

The 2012/2013 title winning season for Manchester United was one great big swansong for Sir Alex Ferguson, who ended his 26 year reign of the club in style. The following season, however, was the complete opposite, with David Moyes masterminding the unravelling of everything Ferguson had created in his tenure. But what could Moyes have done to save the club? And to what extent was failure inevitable?

On the face of it, Moyes had a title winning squad, and therefore he clearly could have bettered his 7th place finish behind his previous club Everton. He had the Premier League’s most consistent goalscorer in Robin van Persie, and many a world class player besides, for example Wayne Rooney and Nemanja Vidic. Therefore, surely it stands to reason that Moyes could, and should, have done better?

Furthermore, he was announced as future United manager long before the end of Ferguson’s last match, and had ample time to think about his transfers. It must be said that United fans would have been surprised if you’d told them that their club’s only signing of the summer would have been the £27 million pound purchase of Marouane Fellaini on the final day of the transfer window. Fellaini, it must be said, has not lived up to his premium price, having not scored in any of his 23 premier league games for the club.

Moreover, Moyes was very unlucky, with Robin van Persie picking up a series of injuries over the season, leading to the Dutchman never finding his Midas touch of gold which the Premier League had come to know so well during the previous year. His lack of fitness meant a dry period in front of goal for United, who combined only scored 64 goals in the season, 22 less than the previous year.

On the other hand, David Moyes’ tactics were stilted at best, and his approach never had the full backing of his senior players, especially when results started to go against them. This idea is exemplified by the 2-2 draw with Fulham at Old Trafford, when United had the most crosses in one match in Premier League history. Moyes tactics seemed to make United play much slower than they had the previous year under Ferguson, and the ‘Chosen One’ started acquiring critics for his style of play. This may have been partly down to the lack of ingenuity and energy from his players: Michael Carrick was one whose standard of play was much lower, and slower, than the previous year.

However, it may not have been the team, but the manager, who was at fault for this. Moyes’ record at Everton was consistent, and he almost always made the top half of the table in his 10 year reign. But his ability to manage a top-class team was questionable: he had never won at Old Trafford, the Emirates, Stamford Bridge or Anfield, or even got his hands on some silverware before he arrived; almost all of these stayed true after he’d left.

Yet, the most important reason why Moyes was never going to satisfy United fans was the fact that he wasn’t Fergie. Ferguson was one of the world’s great managers: able to inspire belief and extra effort from his players; able to reincarnate title winning side after title winning side; the creator of ‘the mind game’. Moyes, on the other hand, was by comparison just ‘some Scottish bloke’ who’d done alright at Merseyside’s second biggest club.

Overall, although Moyes may not have been doomed to fail, he was never going to fulfil the large boots of Sir Alex Ferguson, and would never have been able to replicate the achievements of his predecessor.  We can comfortably conclude that the second Moyes took over, Fergie time was well and truly up.
