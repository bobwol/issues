## 10. Lomana LuaLua: The Seven Back Flip Backward Somersault.

This has got to be one of the most dramatic celebrations in sporting history. Lomana LuaLua celebrated his goals by doing seven back flips and a backward somersault. The celebration apparently stems from his interest in gymnastics. LuaLua was apparently banned from this celebration because he injured his ankle attempting ten consecutive somersaults, while playing for Portsmouth.

## 9. Jimmy Bullard: Mocking the manager

Phil Brown the Hull manager gave Hull a team talk on the pitch during their 5-1 defeat in the Premier League against Manchester City. He felt the performance was schoolboy like and therefore told the team off on the pitch. A year on in the same fixture when Jimmy Bullard equalised with a penalty he sat his team mates down on the pitch and recreated the team talk that his manager had given. Phil Jones in an interview after the match said:  “I couldn't deliver my post-match speech as I was laughing so much. The whole thing was timed to perfection.”

## 8. Katharine Copeland: The Scream

Arguably the most iconic celebration of the 2012 London Olympic games. After winning gold on the water after many years of effort, the relief and happiness was clear on Copeland’s face as her jaw stood agape, seemingly stuck for ten minutes. After the race she said: ‘I can't believe this is real and we just won,’ and joking with her teammate Sophie Hosking: We're going to be on a stamp tomorrow".

## 7. Pat Cash: Running into the stands

Pat Cash won at Wimbledon in 1987 and celebrated by heading through the startled centre court spectators to join his relatives in the players' box. The club had never seen scenes like this before, but as Pat Cash was so popular, not least with the female viewers, it was admired by the public. Cash more or less set the ball rolling with the famous celebration; almost every tennis player now does this.

## 6. Andrew Flintoff: Running out Ponting

One of the moments of the 2009 Ashes. It was day four of the final test and it was seen by many as the moment that regained England the Ashes. In the end England won comfortably by 197 runs but momentum was just starting to shift for the Aussies. The celebration itself was a thing of beauty. Flintoff threw down the stumps and stood arms aloft, chest out, chewing his gum, waiting to be mobbed by his teammates.

## 5. Chris Ashton: Swallow Dive

Love it or hate it, Chris Ashton’s swallow dive is one of the best rugby celebrations of recent times. It was synonymous with Ashton’s great run of form and confidence, culminating in him becoming the 2011 Six Nations top try scorer. The swallow dive became iconic and was copied up and down the country on schoolboy rugby pitches, much to the annoyance of rugby coaches.

## 4. Eric Cantona: Just standing there

Recently Eric Cantona won the best celebration in Premier League history award, by just standing still. That’s right, his incredible chip against Sunderland in 1996 after a great run was followed by Cantona standing with arms outstretched, taking in the applause and admiration of the crowd. It was interesting to see Cantona beating both Bullard and Lualua to the award.

## 3. Mario Balotelli: Why always me?

One of the great personalities to grace the Premier League is undoubtedly Mario Balotelli. He has set off fireworks in his own home, failed to learn how to put on a bib and provided us with one of the most iconic images in the English League’s history. On derby day against local rivals Manchester United, he pulled up his shirt to reveal the phrase: ‘Why always me?’, with his deadpan expression. Something that will live long in the memory of every sports fan.

## 2. Mo Farah: The Mobot

We have seen many of the top celebrations come from the Olympics; this is no exception. Mo Farah became a national hero on Super Saturday of the London Olympics which saw Great Britain gain 3 golds on the athletics track in a night. The excitement and disbelief of sports fans was exemplified by Mo Farah’s mobot celebration as he ran across the line winning gold and extending his arms to make his name ‘Mo’, mouth wide open with amazement and immense joy.

## 1. Usain Bolt: The lightning bolt

The Lightning bolt is considered by many to be the top celebration in sporting history. Not only is Bolt, the fastest man to grace the earth, he is also one of the coolest. Bolt ran the Beijing Olympics 100 metre final with his laces untied and then showed the world the lightning bolt. The unique celebration is definitely the most famous celebration in the world at the moment, as people try to copy their hero.
