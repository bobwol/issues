Towards the end of Pride, a character asks whether ‘Screw Thatcher’ or another similar, unprintable phrase would make a more effective banner slogan. She opts for the former. The film as a whole generally makes the same choice, seldom opting for the most provocative option. Pride’s rare brutality is bubble-wrapped in sentimentality. But this does not mean it pulls its punches: as one character puts it, ‘Screw Thatcher’ is indeed ‘more visceral’ than the alternative. The same applies to this film, where moments of mawkishness reinforce rather than undermine its message.

Pride brings together the stories of 1980s gay rights campaigners and striking miners in a village in south Wales. This, for the average Pauline, no doubt sounds like the very definition of a terrible premise. I confess I do not have an affinity for the film’s politics, but it is to its great credit that I enjoyed it nonetheless. Indeed, the notion that the miners’ protests might ultimately have been futile adds another layer of poignancy, even amidst the laughter.

How does the film balance its humour, pathos and earnestness? I would credit a winning formula of well-chosen, ‘so-bad-they’re-good’ eighties tunes (ABC and Wham! being personal highlights), a taut script and some exceptional performances. Bill Nighy deserves particular credit as a reserved miner. One notable scene between Nighy and Imelda Staunton involving the making of sandwiches is hilarious, heartfelt and hilarious again within the same minute.

Ben Schnetzer makes a determined yet lovable lead, and indeed the entire cast is successful at portraying characters who shared a collective identity (either as a member of a mining community or the Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners group) whilst also bringing out their individual identities as the film progresses. This rich characterisation is what makes the comedy ring so true, while also allowing the plot to venture into the deeper waters of homophobic violence and prejudice of all kinds. The characters’ ultimate vindication of all they stand for is therefore all the more stirring. At least two of my fellow audience members (both, for what it’s worth, members of the LGBT community) were very close to tears.

Much like a decent Wham! track, Pride’s good-natured energy was pervasive and utterly captivating. So much so in fact, that it feels like it should be a guilty pleasure. Yet looking at the film as a whole, it’s as guilt free as a low fat yogurt. This is crowd-pleasing cinema at its very best.
