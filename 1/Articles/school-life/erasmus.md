> Dear Erasmus,<br>
I am afraid to say that I am a member of the 6th form. Recently as I have emerged from the library in seek of companionship, I have been spoken to in a language I cannot understand. How am I to cope when those in my year choose to greet me with “wagwan blud”?

Ah, the only objective of the 6th form year: to look street. Coupled with the increasing danger of the Hammersmith Bridge, never has such a characteristic been needed. Fear not, here are some foolproof responses to help you look like the Tupac of Castelnau Road;

‘Rah, allow him setting me those dead marks, swear down I wrote bare on the onomatopoeic language in that sonnet’
‘I’m on a ting ‘pon my ergo time, imma kill the regatta ‘gainst Corpus Christi college’
‘Safe Jamal, cotch later’

 I was very proud of my M&S suit when I walked into the atrium on the first day of the L8. However, to my horror I was met with Savile Row suits adorned with vast briefcases. Should I continue to be humiliated in my attire or do I spend the last of my savings to dress like them?

The Savile Row x Briefcase is an obvious combination to watch out for, although its accompaniment with bright yellow suspenders and leather shoes is like a peacock; rare but beautiful, not to mention eye catching. Look on the brightside you stylish Pauline, you could very well be wearing the same suits that icons such as James Milner, Wayne Bridge or even Emile Heskey once wore. Embrace it. In relation to a method of carrying one’s notes, a briefcase is much a double edged sword- if you wish, you can look like a prepubescent George Osborne. On the other hand it also warrants the openness in reference to a certain Inbetweeners line that may well echo through the corridors behind you.

Coming from a school which plays very little Rugby, I have effectively been thrown to the lions in my first games sessions of my 4th form career. How can I involve myself with the team without having to show my limited co-ordination or unwillingness to grope a compatriot’s legs?

Many people have been there before, fear not. The editor of this magazine for example, most definitely did not turn up to his first ever rugby session wearing shin pads. Certain things will help you integrate seamlessly into a squad. For example, the classic ‘yeah here mate’ (cue attempt at a drop goal) while warming up will make you look like a usual player. For those in more desperate situations, I would advise making ‘the outside run’ behind the fly half, at a pace resembling an asthmatic ant carrying heavy shopping. Claim tactical knowledge and people will simply stare in awe.

I wake up every day sweating and gasping, fully aware that Mufti day sneaks closer every hour. How should I dress for this prestigious event? Should I throw myself into New York gangster clothing brands like SUPREME or should I opt for the more classical Topman hoodie? What is the dress code?

Mufti day, an event to establish yourself as the resident kingpin of Barnes fashion. Jaws drop as you stride through the broadway, rowers stop and stare while you glide across the bridge before you realise on arrival at school that you have forgotten the money to actually donate to charity. While gecko styled Nike shoes populate the atrium and any idea of fashion sense gets rejected quicker than ICON marketers, it is paramount that you stand out. Previous attempts have featured the ever popular ‘mankini’, the onesie, or the more popular ‘I’m in school uniform because I want to draw attention to myself and my beliefs against charity’. I have devised a foolproof strategy- the Full kit, studs and captain armband inclusive.
