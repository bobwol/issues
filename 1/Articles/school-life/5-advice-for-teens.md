Alcohol: Alcohol is bad. Don’t drink. Especially if you’re a lightweight.

Women: There is a smorgasbord of eligible girl’s school in the West London area. Make use of these. On arriving in university, you will be dealing with far greater competition, mostly people who can bench more than you. Three things to bear in mind. Don’t call girls fat. Don’t ask which breast they prefer and don’t refer to them as piff yatz.Personal experience tells me all of these make them cry.

Cooking: Don’t. Go catered or save up for a butler.

How to make friends: On arriving at university, you will encounter people from the north. They are not to be feared, because I assure you, they are more afraid of you than you are of them. Reach out to them and in time, they may learn that the word butter, does in fact have a ‘t’ in it.

Criminal Activity: Bit of a touchy topic. Don’t do anything illegal. This includes being caught drunk in a Tesco trolley. Apparently a fine-able offense.  Side note to 4th formers; I know many of you endeavour to take the role of ‘bad man’ within your year group. Please don’t. It demeans you and demeans John Colet. Walking with slight shoulder tilt doesn’t make you hard. Neither does addressing your comrades with the greeting ‘ayyyyyy’.

Work: If you have any intellect whatsoever, you should be fully capable of doing no work for the first two and a half years of your school career and still bang a job with the Goldman Sachs. The fourth form is a time for FIFA, not further reading. As you go through the school, it may occasionally be appropriate to work in the evenings, but that’s is fully up to your discretion and in the words of Van Zant, ‘nobody gonna tell me what to do’.

Socialising: During your time at the school, you may be obliged to partake in a ‘pre-gash meet up’. This involves opposing tribes from alternative single sex schools meeting each other in Hammersmith Broadway, but for the first hour, ensuring that the sexes do not cross. It is crucial that you obey this procedure. The minutest deviation from this procedure could lead to full social exclusion, a very upsetting thought indeed.
