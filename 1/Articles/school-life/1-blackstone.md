*Reverend James Blackstone became a new member of staff this year and obviously it was necessary to find out more information about the man who was going to fill the boots of Rev. Allsop. So I suppose it was my Pauline duty to find out if he was up to scratch. Thank God (pardon the pun) I was not disappointed.*

__B&W: What drew you to Philosophy?__

Blackstone: ‘It’s what draws anyone to Philosophy. Questioning. Questioning. Questioning. Constant relentless questioning. Philosophy is just a generalisation of questions. Take nothing for granted.’

__Now that you have observed our behaviour, what piece of advice would you give to Paulines?__

‘Find Joy.’

__If you had a time machine where/when would you go and why?__

‘I think it’s genuinely important to be happy in the present, so I’d probably go around a full circle but to be fair to the question.’ Pause. ‘I’m allowed thinking time right?’ I’d like to visit the writers of the Hindu Upanishads, wonderful texts written in the Indian Forests.’

__Which figure, alive or dead, has influenced you the most in your life?__

‘Jesus Christ.’  So no surprise there…

__What did you do before joining St. Paul’s?__

‘Haha, I have a list to be honest. I worked as a portrait painter, an artist. I’ll tell you a lot about everything then. Well I worked in residential social work, taught English in Poland, lived in a monastery in a contemplative order, taught primary and secondary schools. Other smaller jobs too like pub Work etc. Worked in parishes in London, been an assistant chaplain at UCL. I think that I loved my painting but teaching is definitely the most rewarding but I chose all these professions to merge with one another and most of all benefit others.’

__Which came first the chicken or the egg?__

Pause. Pause. Pause. ‘There is no first.’

__If a tree falls in the middle of the woods and no one hears it; does it make a sound?__

‘Very Zen of you. Very Zen indeed. Yes it does.’

__What is the greatest book of all time?__

‘Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina’

__What is the greatest song of all time?__

‘Any song sung by Johnny Cash?’

__What are your hobbies?__

‘I’ve done a couple 800 mile walks and camped out in the Wild. I travelled to South East Asia, India a number of times, America.’

__Which do you think is the best community of people living in the World?__

It must be the hospitality of the Turkish. The resilience of the Vietnamese.

__And to finish off I had to ask him the cliché Pauline ego-boost questions…As a new teacher what do you think is the best quality of St. Pauls?__

That’s a very difficult question. I don’t deny its success academically but I think the community really strives due to an always forward looking attitude.

*After leaving the interview I felt two emotions. The first being pure shock in the extent of travel, education and overall wellbeing of our new Reverend’s life. The second a feeling of pure jealousy as I realised that Dr. Blackstone possessed the perfect UCAS application.*
