*Seb Mallé is a man governed by his most base passions: women, wine and adrenaline. He lives a life teetering on the precipice of insanity out of choice, “doing what he wants, when he wants”. Inevitably he has amassed a veritable treasure-trove of madcap tales of tomfoolery over the course of his life. For a brief moment he was kind enough to take a second to slow down and lend us his company before he jetted off to his next glamorous rave/orgy/picnic. Here’s how we got on with the young whippersnapper.*

B&W: Hi Seb. Could you tell us how you derived your pseudonym Mallé?
Seb:  I decided to take on my alter-ego when I first visited Paris. There I discovered my love for French culture and French women, and spent a short time as a High-Court Judge, where my customary banging of the gavel (or mallet) became a symbol of French Justice. From then on I was known only as Mallé.

B&W: You’ve had your fair share of excitement in your life - could you give us any notable examples of your derring-do?

Seb: I don’t want to talk about it. I know what you’re angling at.

B&W: Seb, we want you to talk about your cricketing episode.

Seb: No.

B&W: People deserve to know.

Seb: Fine… during a cricket escapade I had a little mishap, that was all. I had a case of “the runs” - to my misfortune they were not the sort of runs that count in a cricket match. I was happy as a clam, frolicking about on the emerald turf, when suddenly I felt a darkness stir in the very core of my being. A sudden uneasiness came over me. Dismissing my premonition as mere silliness I bent down into a catching position to keep wicket. That bending down action triggered an unwanted and unpreventable reaction. My cricketing Whites were now a murky brown... The whole experience was quite mortifying.

B&W: I can imagine. From what I have heard you were quite the class clown that year. Did anything else of note happen? What about an unfortunate cussing match with David Nartey that led to a slip of the tongue on your part? I have heard that that was rather embarrassing for you.

Seb: I stumbled on my words. I had come up with a witty retort which my mouth mangled into “At least you’re not a loner like me”, insulting myself rather than my lingual sparrer. Of course this is balderdash; I have many French mistresses who I count as my friends.

B&W: That brazen lie provides a neat segue into my next question - just how do you attract the fancies of so many young women?

Seb: I use my devilish charm, and ravishing good looks, and I find I just have my way with the females. Also I have a gigantic donger.


B&W: You say this, but recently I heard of a certain french madame who seems to have turned down your trifecta of looks, charm and endowment. Is there any truth to this?

Seb: (guffaws loudly) Well… this certain missus has been indecisive about which male she would like to befriend, so I let this other male take this certain lady as I must return to my other 147 buxom wenches on my hands at the moment back in Paris.

B&W: And finally Seb, tell us three things you would keep if you had to give all else away

Seb: I have a rather large fetish for Cress sandwiches, so a lifetime supply of those. My trusty picnic blanket is a must. I suppose I ought to bring along my Famous Five audio tapes as well, it is their tenacious honesty that keeps me going even on my darkest days.

B&W: Thanks Mallé. Keep doing what you’re doing.
