## Beginnings

One warm, wet August afternoon, your intrepid reporter was stumbling through the slippery cobbled streets of Venice when, either by blind luck or something more sinister, I stumbled upon a quaint old costume shop, offering blessed relief from what could now be confidently termed a downpour. The display in the window seemed… off, somehow, in a way I could not quite put my finger on, but I entered regardless, hypnotised by the prospect of dryness.

Having coaxed life back into my numb appendages, I glanced around the dusty old shop, stacked to the rafters with a plethora of dolls and stray articles of clothing. A wizened, eccentric old man tinkered away in the corner, too engrossed in his work to have noticed either my entry or the accompanying jet of rain. My eye was caught by a seemingly innocuous workbench in the corner, totally bare but for two items: a top hat and a bowler hat. I was seized with intrigue; I had to have one. But which to choose? In truth, the bowler, separately made famous by Charlie Chaplin’s *Little Tramp*, Stanley Kubrick’s *A Clockwork Orange* and *Goldfinger*’s Oddjob, never stood a chance against the top hat, worn by such esteemed visionaries as the Monopoly Man, Willy Wonka, the Mad Hatter, the Artful Dodger, Slash, high-ranking Freemasons, the Cat in the Hat, Abraham Lincoln, most magicians and contemporary hip-hop musician T-Pain.

I handed over two crisp notes to the still-transfixed shopkeeper and gambolled gleefully out of the establishment, clutching the box at my side like a prize chicken.

The cold, hard light of day had rendered my enthusiasm greatly diminished, more rational thoughts having crept into my head. So, by the time I had returned from my holidays, the box still lay untouched, goading me from the corner of my room until I could resist no longer.

## Wearing a Top Hat in Public

I had no choice in the matter, I feel I must stress once again: I did not choose to wear the hat, the hat forced itself on me. Maybe I should have fought back when I still could. It is too late now.

When I first donned the top hat, I had grossly underestimated its potential, convinced that people had bigger fish to fry than my hat (which, if represented in fish form, would probably be a medium-sized one such as a pollock). This was emphatically not the case. In 20 minutes of wearing my hat in public, I was openly laughed at by strangers, given a look of pulverising disdain by an old lady and nearly killed by a man on a speeding bicycle who was clearly very pleased with the mildly facetious nature of my headwear and decided to show his appreciation by attempting to give me a high-five.

I regained my composure and walked into school, foolishly assuming that I would be safe among friends. Of course, I now know that there is a direct and proven correlation between friendship and probability of attempted hat theft, assuming constant hat presence. I suppose that is one of the main lessons I have learned from my ordeal, as well as never to trust a fake cow.

Reactions to my hat varied hugely, from supportive to derisory and everything in between. The single most popular response was to unleash a barrage of unprintable expletives while maintaining an unflinching expression of complete bewilderment. Strangers smiled at me in the street, and almost everybody asked me the same question: why was I wearing the hat? A more rational person might draw some conclusions from my inability to answer this question even after having literally hundreds of opportunities to, but I decided to ignore the implications instead.

## Conclusion

When I first bought my hat, I did not expect to learn anything about the inner workings of modern Western society. It turned out that I was right not to expect much. I have, however, made a much less surprising and significant discovery: society is not yet ready for the reintroduction of the top hat. Nevertheless, I will keep up my crusade, brushing aside everything that stands in my way. From fake cows to low-hanging branches, nothing will stop me from achieving my (poorly-defined) aims. The revolution marches on!
