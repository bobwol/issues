Subject Report: Following my last, perhaps rather scathing report of __PUPIL__ I was encouraged to see improvements in his behaviour in class and work at the start of this term. However, as I sit here writing this report, encompassing the entire term’s work I feel that __PUPIL__ was only lulling me into a sense of false hope and security. After remedy, 6/42, 10/25 and a truly remarkable 2/18 have seen __PUPIL__ drop to bottom of his class and I dread to think what the summer exams hold for him if he continues in this way. Perhaps the only positive that he has gained from this term is that he has moved closer to the point where he can drop __SUBJECT__ find something that he is more applied to, becoming an anarchist perhaps.

Subject Report: Regarding the dropping of the atom bomb, Oppenheimer famously said he was reminded of an ancient Hindu scroll containing the words: ‘Now I am become death, the destroyer of Worlds.’ Although I highly doubt it, perhaps this was what was going through the secretary’s mind as she walked back along the corridor having delivered __PUPIL__ to my classroom. Arriving three weeks in __PUPIL__ was already playing catch-up but apparently has had no intention of settling down with his studies. He has been a thoroughly disruptive influence to his classmates, his actions are erratic and he seems incapable of preventing the first thing he thinks of, whatever it may coming out of his mouth. He seems to never fail to have brought unwanted surprises to my lessons and I suggest he has a long think about the way he conduct himself before returning reformed for the new term.

Subject Report: For __PUPIL__, this term has brought with it new highs, but more frequently it has to be said, new lows. Unfortunately the majority of the ‘highs’ that I speak of mainly stem from his apparently never-ending store of drug related jokes that are both inappropriate and disruptive for the class. Lows include describing the witches in Macbeth as being ‘the three ugly and off their head girls in the club’ and repeatedly spelling the name ‘Duncan’ as ‘Dunkann.’ It should also be noted that ‘having major Mac-beef with Banquo’ is not an appropriate thing to say in an English essay. This image he wishes to maintain as the class joker will not bring him any long- term rewards and I know that __PUPIL__ is very capable when he stops trying to impress his classmates. I urge him to reconsider how he conducts himself in class and focus on realising his potential and obtaining a respectable grade in the summer.
