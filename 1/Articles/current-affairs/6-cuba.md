Picture the scene: a warm tropical city, bustling with new cars – the latest 1952 Buick – and having your mojito brought to you as you sit admiring what lovely holiday you booked at Havana’s hotel Nacional. In the USA, Cuba is admired by the government – and by the media. The world looks at Cuba like it looks at any other Caribbean holiday destination – and you revel in luxury you have conveniently chosen.

However, the perfect view from your deckchair hides a more sinister backdrop. The cars seen driving past are owned by the few lucky enough to live in cities. The waiter who brought you your drink is only employed because he had to leave behind his family – who probably grow cane and join the mass army of seasonally unemployed people – and even now Enrique is underpaid. The Hotel Nacional, and many other tourist traps, are owned by the government ministers, or worse and far more likely, American businessmen and congressmen. Of course the United States loves this country. It owns this country! And the holiday destination, well, that’s just what it is, a place where the wealthy foreigners can come and pay the poor inhabitants to do their bidding: luxury.

Little do you know however, my gringo friend, that in the jungles of this 1953 Cuban ‘republic’ lurks a young lawyer, his brother and a few other brave men who have vowed to have no more injustice and inequality in this police state which they have been forced to live under, both by their dictator, Generalissimo Batista, and by the foreign forces that continue to fund him, the United States of America.

They train in the jungles and gather support in the villages. They attack the forts and win over the cities. They fight with the politicians but join the masses. Faster than anyone could have foreseen, this young lawyer, Fidel Castro, has begun to become a real force – but with little charisma and even less experience. Then, while training in the nearby Mexico, he meets an enigmatic ex-doctor and now freedom fighter, who has battled from Argentina to the Congo, and together they return to war torn Cuba to continue the noble march towards equality.

Now, Fidel and his new companion, el Che, fight onwards with their many compatriots and comrades. Soon enough, they have won, and by ’59, Cuba is finally in the hands of the people.

However, the status quo cannot be changed with such ease, and the some forces with intentions not so honourable will never let the blood of thousands be enough.

The United States of America was, and continues to be, one such threat to true equality. It imposed harsh embargoes on Cuba, and has refused to make these rigid laws lax in any way (even though 61% of the public believe they should). This has caused Cuba to become cut off from the outside world. It cannot survive cut off from its naturally closest importing country. It would be like building a dam around a mountain stream, and expecting the baby deer that rely on the water to somehow manage to keep going. Even worse is the USA’s use of Cuba as an example to ridicule communism because; firstly, its not communist, just very extreme socialism. Secondly, it would very likely have worked perfectly had the US not cut off its trading partners (it would be like placing a bet on an acrobat and then winning because you had chopped off he/she’s leg).

The idea that the Cuba could run almost completely self sufficiently since the collapse of the Soviet Union is utterly ridiculous, but even under these standards Cuba has been able to run better than most countries could under the same set of circumstances. It has some of the world’s best health services, and some of the world’s best educations on offer. Both for free.

The inequality once faced before is far less prominent, and while unemployment is far higher, it is no longer seasonal and the government makes efforts to sustain those who cannot find jobs. Corruption is rife among high levels of government, but this is emphasised a lot more on by the western media than in other countries. As one would find, most countries are faced with high levels of corruption, especially with politicians who hold large amounts of power.

Cuba is a country plagued with many ills, there is no denying that, but taking into account the many hurdles it has been forced to jump through, it not only shows a remarkable hope for the glowing red ember that is communism. Is Cuba the communist dream? No. Cuba is however, far better off now than it was under Batista, and far better off than it should be under America’s unfairly punitive fist.
