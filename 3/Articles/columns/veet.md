“Ignoring all instructions I decided to plunge straight in, pain rarely lasts I thought, how bad can it be?”

Off the back of the rapturous reception that greeted our last review concerning the 'Three Wolves and a Moon Tee' we introduce to you episode two in a series intended to inform you, dear reader, of a range of invaluable products not to be missed.

'Twas the witching hour. Suited up, pre-lashed and smelling like a disaster at a Lynx factory we were ready. It had finally arrived. The night we’d been waiting for. The night we’d become men. Lying awake staring at the ceiling for the past three and a half years, it had often felt as if it would never arrive (Rissy Q-mar'z filthy underground mixtape hadn't done a lot to help the struggle). For this was not just any night. Oh no. This was the holy grail. This was... the FEATHERS BALL (and if you've watched American Pie/The Devil Within you’ll know what we’re talking about). This was it. Dates arranged (speak to one ‘Tyrone Gwen’ for details) we knew we had to be on top form. Being men of a hirsute nature, however, we'd known we couldn't afford to make the renowned amateur-associated failure and hence had heeded the wise-words of those gone before us. Their advice rung deafening in our ears, "Don't forget to shave".

We'd decided to address this problem the week before. The razor beckoned us yet in fear we'd shuddered; the aftermath of our last encounter with the conniving instrument still stained the walls of the inside of Gus’ lost property office. Never again.  

In dire need of advice we turned to the ultimate bastion of wisdom, Anything 2 Say? Tick. Tock. Minutes turned to hours, hours turned to days, days turned to years, years turned to months, months turned to minutes. The beast stirred. From deep within the bowels of control lab 3 a note was sent forth. Legend tells that Anything 2 Say? 'employs' a very clandestine man known as the "courier"/"the mole"/"that guy from the lunch hall" and, in confirmation of these whispers, it was indeed he who made contact. Well, when we say contact, we mean he literally physically accosted us. Walking out of the lunch hall we were mowed down by a rolling stack of trays. In the chaos that ensued (and unnoticed by us at the time) the note found itself a new owner.

'Twas on a Geography field trip upon the River Tillingbourne, just South of Guildford and off the A281 that the wisdom (which had for so long remained elusive to us) revealed its secrets. Whilst playing poo sticks a gust of wind blew the fabled parchment from our pocket. It read but one word. In French. VEET. Which translates into English as... VEET.  

There was no time to lose. We had but 4 days and 37 hours to get ready. Mahmoud was called. The deal went down. We had la crème. It was time for application.

And so we arrive back at the night of the prom. Alas, we had not been informed about the quantities required for such an endeavour. Three tubs seemed reasonable. Staring deeply into one another’s eyes, we gently squatted into the tepid crème. It felt as if we were dunking our manhood into a Tupperware pot of crème. We had to concentrate; one false move and we’d have to reapply. Strict instructions stipulated that we had to maintain the squat for NO MORE than half a minute. But we are men, surely it would take longer? After approximately 9 minutes and 32 seconds, it began.  

So now, dear reader, we arrive back at the original purpose of the article: the review.

Those who have seen the film “Black Hawk Down” can relate to the feeling that emanated from our nether-regions. The pain was searing. Unbearable. Wincing, we clutched for a nearby length of rope to try to cut off blood supply using a makeshift torque. Unfortunately, it turned out there was no nearby length of rope. By now, the pain was so intense that even our screams turned to muffled whimpers. In this humbling moment of suffering we had but one conjoined thought: the freezer. Through systematic blackouts we flew downstairs, crashing headfirst through anything in our path (most notably a Tang Dynasty vase and a lifetime supply of “I can’t believe it’s not butter” which, oddly, was located outside of the kitchen…). Coated in butter and shards of 6th Century pottery, we slid into the kitchen. It was now, nursing considerable head wounds, that we regretted installing specifically small doorways.  Tearing the freezer door off its already considerably dangerous hinges we reached for the ice-cream. Blessed relief. The cool winter-fruits flavoured substance (courtesy of ‘Thai Tanic’) soothed our dingleberries... for a brief time. It soon melted, however, in the chthonic heat of our wedding vegetables. We were left fetal, covered in butter and lukewarm ice cream. Suddenly it occurred to us that we had only 3 hours until the Prom. Once the crying had subsided we took solemn showers, trying to think past the trauma of the last 4 minutes.

Needless to say, the Prom did not go well. As it turns out, it’s difficult to enjoy an evening when your crotch feels as though it is trying to overthrow the bourgeoisie.

If however, dear reader, you come prepared (ice/on site paramedic team/a Canada Goose Coat etc.), the crème does its job pretty well.
