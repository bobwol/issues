title: "A Strained Relationship: Tatler Magazine’s Views on St Paul’s"

The Tatler-St Paul’s relationship has long been a rocky one. Perhaps our intellectual aggression, cement buildings, and Barnes location intimidated well-off mothers in their Belgravia drawing rooms, who make up 99% of Tatler’s readership (and 100% of that of their so-called “Schools Guide”). While conceding St Paul’s School’s academic excellence, one review of SPS in the 2006 edition of the “Schools Guide” scorned our “ghastly sixties architecture”, while another compared St Paul’s to Grange Hill, the grotty North London comprehensive from the television series of the same name. The authors must have found the comparison to a school funded by taxpayers’ money eternally damning.

Tatler continued their unbridled assault on St Paul’s in the 2008 Guide, insinuating that it was viewed as an “exam factory”. Fortunately, one witty student amongst us retorted “We’re more like a free range, organic exam farm actually.” Bless that man. A dose of dry Pauline wit unsurprisingly triumphs over such idiotic generalisations.
To be fair to them, Tatler have cleaned up their act in recent years, calling SPS “the king of the London day school jungle” and Paulines “extremely high-achieving, clever boys who still know how to have fun”. Maybe the Master Plan and the soaring price of Barnes real estate have converted our Sloane Ranger companions, and the conversion is very welcome indeed.
But Tatler had better watch itself. Its “tut-tut, they dropped 2.5 per cent A*-B at A-level last year” remark in this year’s guide successfully rattled my cage. Criticising us first for being an exam factory, and then chastising us on the grounds of our exam results seems self-contradictory at best, and profoundly hypocritical at worst.  Perhaps the comment was ironic-  I’ll give Tatler the benefit of the doubt. In any case, I look forward to seeing what the 2016 issue has in store.
