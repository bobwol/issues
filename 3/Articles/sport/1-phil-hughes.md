title: "The Tragedy of Phil Hughes"

On the 25th of November last year, at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Australia, Phillip
Hughes was struck on the base of the head by a ball, an injury that he would not recover from. His death shocked the sporting world, sparking a hashtag on twitter ‘#Putoutyourbats’ , in remembrance of this hugely talented sportsman, who had his whole career, and more importantly his life, ahead of him.

When the ball hit his head, it caused a vertebral artery dissection, which led to a subarachnoid haemorrhage, an injury that the Australian team doctor has claimed only ‘a hundred such cases have ever been reported of’. Hughes almost immediately lost consciousness, as the ball hit him behind his left ear, right above his cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls conscious thought. He was rushed to hospital, where he was placed into an induced coma. He died two days later. He was only twenty six.

Hughes was an outstanding cricketer. He burst onto the scene in 2009 against South Africa, when in his second test he scored a century in both innings, becoming the youngest man ever to do so, at the tender age of 20. This prompted many to start calling him the ‘next Bradman’, a tag likely to daunt any young cricketer. Although he didn’t quite live up to the exceedingly high standards of ‘The Don’, Hughes became an established member of both the Test and One Day formats of the game. Some of his other highlights include two centuries in one ODI series against Sri Lanka. England fans may remember his partnership with Ashton Agar last year of 163, the largest tenth-wicket partnership in the history of the game.

Hughes once said in an interview that if he hadn’t been a cricketer, he’d have been on his farm where he grew up and learnt to play the game, with his dad. In fact, Hughes had recently bought 90 hectares (220 acres) of land back in Macksville where he grew up, as well has 70 Angus Cattle. It seems as though he was already preparing to return back to a comfortable life back home; this all seems to make his death even more tragic.

Behind all of this, we have a second tragedy; that of 22 year-old Sean Abbott, the New South Wales fast bowler. He must have been feeling distraught, as he was the person that bowled the bouncer that killed Hughes. As a fast(ish) bowler myself, I can understand that Sean may never want to bowl a ball again; how would you continue to run in hard and bowl fast if you’re worried that the end result may have fatal consequences? What must be even worse for Abbott is that he knew Hughes personally. Michael Clarke however, the Australian captain and very close friend of Hughes, has come out and said that ‘Sean, when you’re ready I will be the first one to go down the other end of the net.’ Such support is admirable in times such as these, and an inspiring statement from a great cricketer.

On the back of this catastrophe, there are people who have started to complain about helmet safety; supposedly the distance between the protection and the temple is too little, the faceguard could be forced onto the face in impact, and, as we have sadly witnessed, there is a blind spot just beneath the joint of the grill and the main part of the helmet.  The question is, was this a freak accident, impossibly unlikely to occur again in the next hundred years, or is this a serious problem that the cricketing authorities need to address?

However, it is this exceptional blend of risk and reward, success and failure, that makes sport so inspiring. These unbelievable physical specimens, that set the bar so high in their respective professions, have captured the hearts and minds of millions across the world; Sachin Tendulkar is given godlike status in India, Diego Maradona a prince everywhere in Argentina.

This effect is amplified now as a result of modern technology; each little flick of Ronaldo’s caught on ten different cameras, every dummy sold by Dan Carter immortalised online, all of Lewis Hamilton’s daring overtakes replayed across the globe. Each one available in their thousands on the internet, each one able to inspire a child to go outside and practise himself.

Furthermore, we are now closer to the world of our idols than ever, as we can find endless interviews online, twitter feeds, instagram pictures, which give your average viewer a much greater understanding of the person as a whole. This can also bring you to feel more emotionally attached to them.

And therefore, when one of these idols, or demi-gods, fall, it is all the more poignant. We see them to be so immense and exceptional that when we lose one it is somehow more shocking. This is  especially the case in the sporting arena, as although there is risk, we don’t expect any of the competitors to actually die.

Formula One is a sport ridden with tragic accidents over the years, but since health and safety has taken over the sport, fewer people crash, fewer people die. To that effect, when Jules Bianchi, the 25 year old Marussia driver, tragically crashed, and was subsequently induced into a coma to save his life, the world of Formula was almost shocked into silence.

However, there was not the same amount of global coverage, for the sole reason that Bianchi’s incident was a car crash, albeit at seriously high speeds, an accident that happens every day. Hughes’ equivalent was a freak, that nobody could have predicted or suspected. When you walk onto a cricket pitch, you don’t expect to be carried off unconscious.

This is what has made Hughes’ death so tragic for everybody; not that I knew him personally, but from interviews I’ve watched, from accounts that I’ve read, he seemed to be such a genuine, down to earth guy. And that is why it has hit the whole sporting realm so painfully hard. I only hope that this incident really is a one-off, as cricket could not recover from another accident like this.

As Michael Clarke has recently said, ‘See you out in the middle’. Phillip Hughes, forever 63 not out at the SCG.
