From the start of the world cup it was hard to look beyond Australia, New Zealand or South Africa. The Aussies and Kiwis are on home soil and both of their teams are full of confidence so anything less would undoubtedly be a disappointment. South Africa have a strong pace attack backed up by a good spinner in Imran Tahir. However South Africa tend to choke and have a history of falling short against bigger teams but this year I feel they are due the trophy.
Before the world cup started I saw England as dark horses but after our dismal displays against Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka, my mind has changed. I then decided to go for India as dark horses which may seem an odd thing to say about the defending champions but let’s be honest, no one expects them to win the world cup with the bowling line up that they have. Despite their bowling not being the best, India have match winners in most of the batsmen and are an excellent tournament side.

Whether he will be on the winning or losing team, there is one man who will undoubtedly come out this World Cup a legend.Can anyone stop him? AB de Villiers looks unstoppable when he gets going and it seems that no bowling attack can contain him when he fires.
De Villiers smashed 162 off just 66 balls against the West Indies in what will go down as one of the greatest innings in cricket history.
The South African legend has repeatedly stated that he is just lucky but this is the second time I have seen him ‘get lucky’ in a month. Only in January he scored a remarkable 149 off 41 deliveries which included the fastest ever one day international century off only 31 balls.
He is currently the top ranked batsman in the world and although his outstanding talent with the bat is fascinating it is his humble nature that is most admirable.
After scoring the fastest 150 in history against the West Indies he said ‘A very enjoyable knock today. It was just one of those knocks, a little bit of luck and I made it count’. As much as he downplays these wonderful scores he will always set the stadium alight.
By the end of these extraordinary innings it seemed as if records were being broken with every ball, as we witnessed the unorthodox and unbelievable shots that he has made himself famous for.
What makes AB De Villiers so special? He is a remarkable player who can score 360 degrees around the pitch and it appears that bowlers don’t know what to do. Any delivery they bowl he can play any shot to. The 31 year old now holds records for the fastest 50, 100 and 150 in ODI cricket. His average of 52.93 speaks volumes of his consistent batting form.
AB De Villiers is a superstar leading from the front.
