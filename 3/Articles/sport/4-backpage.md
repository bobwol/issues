title: "Backpage is making a comeback!"

It is with great delight that I can inform you of the return of something almost as popular as Anything to Say.  That’s right!  Backpage is back!  Claiming to be the school’s premier sporting magazine and now using a two year old Facebook page they’re back and quite frankly looking worse than ever.

The only thing that’s harder to get a hold of nowadays in this fine establishment are 8th Formers with ties on.  Where did it all go wrong, you ask?  Well, to be blunt, I ask: when was it ever not?  A magazine that claims to be able to challenge the power and pedigree of Black and White, like the Weimar Republic, was doomed to fail from the start.

There are a few basic things required to write a successful magazine.  First, and not to be underestimated, is articles.  Yes,  articles.  Or, for that matter actually, writers.  Believe it or not, writers and their consequent articles are actually required if you wish to publish and sell a vaguely successful magazine.  However, any writer with the slightest shred of self-respect is already writing for the huge variety of other good magazines on offer at our school, such as Black and White, and um… well… Black and White?

Another key feature of a successful magazine is a strong and powerful advertising campaign.  This would appear to be entirely non-existent.  Indeed, if you look at the Backpage Facebook page and its one post in the last two years you may come to the conclusion that in fact no one cares.  Not even the writers at Backpage.  Not even the mothers of the writers at Backpage.  Never have I seen a more desolate page.  The only strong point of their campaign is that it serves as a constant reminder of the complete failure of yet another so-called school “magazine.”

So.  If you’re keen to write an article about your passion for a particular sport and never wish for it to see the light of day, let alone be read, you know where to go!

On another, totally separate note which has absolutely nothing to do with the underlying motive of the above article, I would like to notify any aspiring sports journalists who want to achieve success that Black and White are looking for more writers.  Feel free to get in touch about further details on writing for Black and White or just go ahead and send me your articles right now.

P.S. The above views are not officially endorsed by Black and White magazine and in no way imply the opinions of Black and White.  However, Black and White does not disagree with the aforesaid views and would not not disagree if you did not accept the above views.
