More than two months after the tragic events of the 7th of January, the scenes of the Charlie Hebdo shootings still remain vivid in the minds of many. Apart from creating endless debates on Free Speech and Pluralism, it has encouraged many to learn to value the opinions of others, and respect the right of others to voice these views. Indeed, proving somebody wrong in a debate is infinitely more powerful than silencing them with a gun.

Accordingly, this issue of Black and White features a number of debates and strong opinions. The role of Israel is re-evaluated by Harry Snider in response to last issue’s article ‘The New Anti-Semitism’, providing the school with the first ever debate to occur through the medium of a school magazine. However, while this landmark arguably demonstrates that St. Paul’s is moving forwards, Hugh Laurence is keen to argue otherwise, with his opinions on the school’s seemingly backwards attitude to sexism showing that this institution still has a long way to go.

Unfortunately, within the furore of the aftermath of the killings, journalists, politicians and ‘tweeters’ alike were all guilty of double standards, blindly forgetting to judge themselves before judging others. This publication, however, does not have such a problem: Alex Gresty is quick to point out that America is hardly a haven for Free Speech in his piece, while Michael Sackur urges us to explore Religion and the Sexist double standards. In a more banal but equally poignant way, Toby Lowenstein makes us laugh at our own culture, one which advertises male hair removal cream, by providing an excellent analysis of his experience with such a product.

Through the tunnel of darkness that was the 7th of January, we should try and see glimpses of light. The acts of courage, as inspected by Tyler Jackson in ‘The Real Hero of Charlie Hebdo Attacks’, and the worldwide condemnation of the violent murders help us to gain hope. Proving one’s point through debate rather than violence has never been a more important concept, and so, while you swipe through this issue, we urge you to voice your opinions by e-mailing them to BlackAndWhite@StPaulsSchool.org.uk.
