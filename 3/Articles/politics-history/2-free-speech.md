title: "Caging Free Speech"

The USA PATRIOT ACT (Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act) is truly a remarkable thing. Not only has it given the right for authorities to snoop at will and hold terrorism suspects without trial indefinitely, it has also had a lesser known effect of caging free speech, quite literally.  The United State’s Constitution guarantees the freedom of speech for all its its citizens. However, one U.S. federal judge decided that whilst it protects the right to speak freely, the constitution does not dictate the freedom to speak wherever one wants.This means that you, dear reader, can say what you want but not where you want.

This has led to the creation of “Free Speech Zones”, more commonly known as  “Free Speech Cages”. In the 2004 Democrat National Convention, protestors were confined to a small wire cage, both reducing their numbers and reducing their ability to influence the politicians hundreds of metres away. This, the protesters claimed, was a direct violation of their 1st Amendment rights. Yet there has been no repeal of the law.  Such zones are now so common in the U.S that they have appeared in TV shows such as Arrested Development which features a tiny cage full of protesters in the desert surrounded by heavily armed police. Is the existence of such a thing an anomalous result of a particular judgement in a federal court? Or is it more indicative of a general trend of the repression of basic freedoms?

The question is: is this justified? At what point does restricting freedoms for the purpose of safety become tyrannical? Benjamin Franklin once said that “those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.” When the PATRIOT ACT (which coincidently reduces the right to Freedom of Assembly, the Security of Person and the Right to Due Process) was passed through Congress, it was said that not one member read it through in its entirety. True, it was rushed through following the 9/11 attacks, but such a drastic change to the law surely deserved greater scrutiny. Russell Feingold was the only man to vote against the measure. He said that “preserving our freedom is one of the main reasons that we are now engaged in this new war on terrorism. We will lose that war without firing a shot if we sacrifice the liberties of the American people”. What does it mean when the supposed leader of the West can pass draconian, tyrannical laws through the senate without debate? Have the terrorists truly won?
