Liberté. Egalité. Fraternité.

These three words are the foundation of freedom for millions. They define a nation, and unite people in a time of distress. Quite frankly, the Charlie Hebdo attacks have been branded as a “grim day in the history of the western world”, frequently compared to the attacks of 9/11. They remind people of anarchy, where a small group has decided that they could not only hurt us with terrorism but break us apart. But one man in particular simply laughed in the face of the terrorists.

It was a Muslim policeman, Ahmed Merabet, a gendarme from a local police station who was “slaughtered like a dog”, after heroically trying to stop two armed murderers from fleeing the Charlie Hebdo offices.

In fact, it was the image of Merabet’s killing on a Paris pavement that most shocked French police and the wider public. As millions took to social media sites to stand strong against the terrorists, with the catchphrase “#JeSuisCharlie” flourishing, \@Aboujahjah summed up in less than his 140 character limit exactly what the hero’s actions meant.

He posted: “I am not Charlie, I am Ahmed the dead cop. Charlie ridiculed my faith and culture and I died defending his right to do so.”

This, if nothing else on that day, sparked chaos. Within hours people were using the chic new #JeSuisAhmed handle. People were standing up and proclaiming the importance to stand behind those who fight for freedom. People were coming together to fight not only for justice, but for free speech, just as Merabet had done. Simply, Merabet’s actions kept a nation together.

Ahmed did his job as would any other police officer, and importantly he didn’t allow any personal ties to affect his judgement, unlike many cases in the United States for example. Furthermore, his decision showed how he chose to stand up for freedom: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of choice, despite the fact that Charlie Hebdo had been a source of political and religious satire for years, making fun of everything he believed in. Yet, Ahmed chose to defend their right to do so - literally to death - much like Voltaire had proclaimed.

Had he not, had he decided that because Charlie Hebdo had attacked his beliefs then he would fight back against them, the idea of liberty would have been destroyed.

Understandably, in response to the murder of so many of their colleagues, the Charlie Hebdo survivors wanted to make a statement against terrorism. They demonstrated clearly that they wouldn't be intimidated by a bunch of Islamic extremists. They showed that they wouldn't be deflected from their democratic right of freedom of speech to mock whoever and whatever they so choose. They continued to fight for what Ahmed started.

That day, liberty was threatened, equality was battered, but brotherhood was never stronger. Even though the terrorists had retaliated with force to Charlie Hebdo’s satirising of their faith, Ahmed’s response brought the nation together as one to fight for liberty and equality. On a day where so much of the nation’s heart and foundations had been crushed, it’s difficult to see how they could have picked themselves up if brotherhood has fallen apart.

Ahmed Merabet died so that Charlie Hebdo could exercise its freedom to ridicule and insult all that he held most sacred. He gave his life to protect Charlie Hebdo's right to deride his beliefs. If it's a hero we're looking for, or a token of freedom, Ahmed Merabet is a far more eligible candidate than Charlie Hebdo.
