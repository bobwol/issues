John du Pont shot Dave Schultz on 26th January 1996. It takes two hours for this pivotal event to occur in *Foxcatcher*. As pivots go, this one is slightly skewered. I take no issue per se with slow build-ups to climactic events, but the fact that the killing seems completely random implies to me that the film failed to make it seem like an inevitability and more of a last minute attempt to grab the audience's attention and leave an impact. Sometimes the truth really is stranger than fiction, but it's not a good sign if this occurs to you whilst you're watching something purporting to be truth.

In case you wish to complain that I have spoiled the film by revealing its ending, I can only say that it needs something to ratchet up the suspense and a knowledge of the impending death of one of the characters can only aid this purpose. The film maintains a monochromatically dark atmosphere throughout. Good moments, such as the helicopter-bound cocaine use and a bizarre attempt by the slight John du Pont to muscle a group of professional wrestlers to the ground, are subsumed by a grim, leviathanic whole.

A redeeming feature is the skinny, hollow-eyed du Pont who leers and stalks like a mellow Richard III. Steve Carell perfectly embodies the character's weedy intensity with a voice which is eternally on the verge of a whisper and a physicality which glides as much as it does walk. A moment at which he appears in black tie at another character's door at midnight is genuinely chilling. But why, why, why does he kill Dave Schultz? *Foxcatcher*'s failure to answer this fundamental question is glaring.

Channing Tatum is inoffensively bland as wrestler Mark Schultz, whom du Pont recruits to take part in a wrestling training facility. *Foxcatcher* grants wrestling an oily, Hellenic, even balletic, elegance which seems at odds with the sport's brutality. Mark Ruffalo shines as Mark's sympathetic brother and fellow wrestler, Dave. In early scenes of them wrestling together, one can often see Mark's hulking apathy to the world at large block Dave's affection. This nuance is not explored beyond the most plodding of plot points: Mark leaves Dave behind to join du Pont, infatuated by promises of rekindling America to its former glory. Dave stays behind, wanting to care for his family, while Mark gawks at him and leaves nonetheless. Finally, Dave does join Mark at the *Foxcatcher* training centre, bringing his family with him, but one is granted no sense of his internal conflict over doing so. Is this a film limited by its source material? Quite possibly.

What is this fox which du Pont is determined to chase and catch? Surely, it is not money for the film is saturated with what may be intended to be old world decadence, coming across here as wing-collared, teak-lined, nouveau riche impudence.

Could it be, perchance, that du Pont pursues that infernal mistress: the American Dream? Yes, yes it could. But *Foxcatcher* ultimately raises more questions than it resolves, none of which succeeded in occupying my attention once I had passed through the cinema doors.
