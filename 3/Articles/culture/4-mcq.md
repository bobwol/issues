I am acutely aware of how few people at this school care about high fashion. But I do, so I’m writing about it. Savage Beauty is the largest ever retrospective exhibition of the work of Lee Alexander McQueen and the first one to appear in Europe. The display spans almost two decades of visionary, beauty-defining creations, and has been hailed by critics as one of the most impressive artistic collections to be seen this year. Fresh in from New York, the collection features hundreds of unbelievably intricate projects, for some of which the man-hours for creation stretch into the thousands. Here are five reasons to go:

1. Everyone’s talking about it.
2. Okay not everyone. But as I said before, it’s a huge event, and you would appear really cultured if you could mention it and not sound pretentious.
3. It’s a great date idea. Talk about the dress designed to make the model look a bit like a duck. Impress your significant other with meaningless sentences about how loads of different things speak to you. Maybe even buy that significant other a dress. Or maybe not - they’re around £25,000 minimum.
4. Culturally, fashion is important. Economically, more so. McQueen had a fortune of $30 million before he committed suicide in 2010. Kering, who own the brand, boast annual profits of over a billion euros. Go figure.
5. Everything there is really, really spectacular. Here are some of the best pieces:
