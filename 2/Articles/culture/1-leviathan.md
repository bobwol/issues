Oceans have seldom encapsulated as much foreboding as the Arctic does in *Leviathan*. Throughout the film, the blue-grey expanse churns and purrs, gradually swallowing piece after piece of the characters’ lives. If *Leviathan*’s characters are stoic, then the landscapes themselves must be assigned the same characteristic. They are weather blown and haggard; all vibrancy has been drained to revel bare rock, earth and foliage.

Aleksey Serebryakov’s Nikolay is fighting for his small house against a dishonest and vicious mayor. The mayor wants the plot of land to build himself ‘a palace’ given the area’s beauty. This reasoning is bizarre given the overabundance of land (and, indeed, beauty) on which the camera dwells, but characters seldom look to the mountains; they prefer to fix their gaze on the sea. That the mayor’s absurdity does nothing to undermine his power is amongst the film’s motifs. He doesn’t care about how beautiful the valley is, but he does become incensed by Nikolay’s refusal to give it up.

Subtextually, of course, there is far more at stake than a house. For Nikolay, his home represents his freedom against the leviathan that is an all-encroaching, deeply corrupt state. Is this struggle a microcosm of contemporary Russia? Most assuredly so, although I feel that its satirical aspects are merely the backdrop to an intense human tragedy. The plot is described as a reworking of the Book of Job. Certainly, the line ‘Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook or press down his tongue with a cord?’ which is quoted by a character towards the end of the film seems apt given the hopelessness of Nikolay’s struggle. Yet unlike Job, he is faced with no prospect of clemency as his suffering is imposed not for the sake of God but, seemingly, for suffering itself.

This is perhaps to sell *Leviathan* as far grimmer than it really is. While its grey-infused colour pallet may suggest otherwise, the film is in fact peppered with moments of humour and the characters are often drawn in light hearted strokes. The phrase ‘Let’s drink,’ is thrown around often, acquiring a blackly humorous resonance. Characters drink to wake up, sleep and facilitate arguments, reconciliations and target shooting. One muses that surely, had the vodka bottles not been filled with water, the actors could not have survived the shoot. Alcohol becomes the grammar of these people’s lives: drunkenness is perpetual; sobriety is to face the stark reality that everything will sink into the ocean.

Yet this utter desolation offers a kind of catharsis by the end, and it is heartening the see characters fight, even against the inevitable. Nikolay calls upon a lawyer friend from Moscow who petitions every public official he can find to review the decision to seize Nikolay’s house. Ultimately, however, it is to no avail.

It must be said that the subtitled dialogue occasionally comes across as clunky. This could just as easily be the fault of a translator as a scriptwriter, but to see the lawyer say ‘How do you sleep at night?’ is to feel that his character has been undermined by cliché.

Yet nothing can undermine the superb nature of *Leviathan* as a film, both political and personal. Despite being a small tale of one man’s decline at heart, it achieves the scale of an epic.
