Sunday 2nd November. Grey clouds drizzled rain onto a dull, lethargic morning. While the masses St Paul’s desperately clung onto the last day of the Autumn remedy, I found myself at school. At 8:30 in the morning. As the main buildings braced themselves for the onslaught the next day, a new one was slowly waking up after its recent birth. A pale, yellow block with long glass doors on the outside; cuboidal in shape with marbled grey steps leading up to it. With bright corridors around the sides, leading to an open conservatory area at the back. With a back room full of cables and lighting. With a shining control room and teaching rooms circling over two floors and finally, a mesh grid. A high tensile wired platform, it combined with these other features forms a great ring around the grandest, most beautiful stage which in turn is set in front of arcs of purple seats, all waiting – all tentatively silent. In a little over eleven hours this building would hold one of our school’s greatest receptions for generations. Celebrities, Mercers, teaching staff past and present, Old Paulines and current Paulines alike would witness the Opening Gala of the new Samuel Pepys Theatre.

While the next few hours were spent preparing, programming and refining acts, familiar faces of those Old Paulines turned up at the doorstep; legends of Pauline drama who had all been invited back to perform pieces to represent years of success and achievement. Indeed, while the solemn skies still casted a miserable atmosphere, a quiet, yet tumultuous uproar was building up as the 7:30 start approached.

Actors rehearsed in their rooms and on stage; the tech crew prepared props and lighting; orchestra members tuned instruments; and Mr Williams oversaw it all – nothing but perfection was required. As the door opened for first tours, a pensive group of actors and crew anxiously assembled in the corridors awaiting the 4 hour spectacle.

Once the suits had filled the great arena, one of the most memorable pieces in recent years gave them a warm, 1930s German welcome: the Cabaret boys. A beautifully choreographed and passionate performance, it was then followed by two groups of talented Coletine actors, taking extracts from Shakespeare’s “Macbeth” and William Golding’s “Lord of the Flies.”

Indeed, this level of acting was kept throughout the night, as excerpts from plays such as Journey’s End, The Two Gentlemen of Verona, and Locusts of Mars were performed.

A memorable evening, the show proved to be a gallant success as a whole: combinations of humour from comedian Hal Cruttenden (a Pauline from the 1980s) and the ever-creative cast of Impsoc; reflective and thought-provoking monologues; poignant live music and dance pieces; supremely acted plays. All were met with rapturous applause and admiration for the quality and effort of the evening.

The show drew to a close with a rousing, audience-included rendition of “We don’t want to lose you.” it capped what had been years of planning and building, months of rehearsing and programming and hours of hard work and dedication on the day.

Special thanks must be given to theatre technicians Dan Staniforth and Nicola Block; student members of Theatre FX; Mr Wilderspin and orchestra members; all actors, directors; and of course Mr Williams, without whom none of this would have been possible.

The new theatre shall no doubt be the crux of Pauline drama for the next generation; beautifully designed with state of the art equipment, it matches the high level and expectation that is instilled in our school. An exciting new beginning- I think I speak for all in expressing gratitude for such an opportunity.
