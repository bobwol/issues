In a recent article by the Daily Mail, St Paul’s was singled out for encouraging boys to abandon their uniform whilst walking home. While the lack of verified facts used was surprising, more alarming were the comments below. “They will still be recognised by the toff walk....hands clasped behind their backs,nose up high and refusal to make eye contact with everyone else in the community” read one, “my how the rich have lowered themselves to try to be ‘normal’” read another, seemingly insinuating that students here do not consider what is happening in the world outside the gates of Lonsdale Road.

This issue, however, proves otherwise. The social awareness of Paulines shines through in these articles, proving to be acutely aware of a whole range of problems on this planet, ranging from gender inequality to the ever-escalating crisis between Israel and Palestine. In fact, this publication, if anything, is encouraging pupils to expand their vision even more; Joachim Robine’s article implores us to look past the OCR inspired interpretation of of ‘The Treaty of Versailles’ and to meticulously take into account other aspects to help us form a bigger picture.


In a more banal but equally valid way, Uday Maudgil urges us to take a step back: what is this obsession with St. Hilda’s? This is not the only instance where we can see Paulines laughing at their own perverseness in this instalment, especially Alex Osmond and Milo Mahon who take no prisoners in satirising the Young Enterprise process.

Ultimately, we must accept that this world revolves around opinions. Indeed, opinions play a strong part in this edition: Theo Anton and Jake O’Keeffe outline theirs in a piece on Anti-Semitism, and we hope to hear yours via email to publish in the next issue. While we cannot change the view of those who have written these comments on the Daily Mail website in a snap of our fingers, I am confident that this issue of Black and White is a resolute way of proving that Paulines are not all we are accused of being.
