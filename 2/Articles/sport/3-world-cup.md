## England

England are solid and could definitely get out of the ‘Group of Death’, considering their home advantage and that they have beaten group rivals Wales and Australia in the last 12 months. Strength in depth is always key at World Cups, and England have it, as shown by their injury ravaged squad still beating The Aussies this Autumn. Despite this, they seem to lack the spark players that previous sides have shown like Jason Robinson. Perhaps, however, that will suit the traditional English style of grinding out victories. One year before a World Cup is possibly the worst time to be reconsidering who will play fly-half, but Owen Farrell’s form has been worrying, and George Ford showed promise when he started in the Autumn, leaving the coaching staff with a tough decision to make. If England fans are honest, they can hope to scrape past the quarter finals, but not much further, and with such a tough group anything could happen…

## Wales

Can they? No. Probably not. Wales prove to be the most frustrating side to support; for every Grand Slam a step forward is made, but consistent victories over the Southern Hemisphere are still elusive. The recent Autumn Internationals proved this, with agonising defeats to Australia and New Zealand, yet a rousing victory against South Africa. This first victory against a Southern Hemisphere side in 23 attempts could give Wales a confidence boost for the group stage in 2015, but as with the other European nations, the 6 Nations will be crucial for their World Cup campaign. Unlike England, the squad has little strength in depth, but finally, Wales seem to have a good fly-half on their hands, with Dan Biggar in fine form in the Autumn Internationals. If he can kick on in the 6 Nations, it would give Wales a solid basis for the World Cup. If, and this is a big if, they can manoeuvre their way out of the group, they could have a chance of a solid semi-final appearance…that is if they don’t encounter Alain Rolland.

## Australia

Completing the trio in the group of death is Australia and, much like the others, it is difficult to predict how they will fare in the quest to top the pool. What they hold over England and Wales are those flair players who can create something out of nothing: Quade Cooper, Israel Folau and potentially Kurtley Beale if he gets brought back into the fold permanently. However, Beale and Cooper could also be Australia’s undoing with their poor temperament and performance under pressure. Overall, I think the Wallabies look the weakest out of the three, losing to Ireland and England over the Autumn, and only beating Wales due to numerous mistakes from the Dragons, so I’d put my money on them to be knocked out at the group stage, especially with home support for their rivals.

## Ireland

The dark horses of this World Cup now, after their performances against South Africa and Australia, and even their narrow defeat to New Zealand in Autumn 2013. Their defence of the Six Nations crown in 2015 will determine their credentials and if they can show the form they did this Autumn, they could be on course for a real challenge at the World Cup. Jonny Sexton continues to stake his claim on the world stage with his nomination for world player of the year, and Coach Joe Schmidt seems to be leading the team in a very positive direction.

## France

I’m not sure I’ll even bother. Predictably unpredictable. Whatever I write they will do the opposite. Beating Australia one week, losing to Argentina the next. The French have seen an influx of promising ‘French’ South Africans such as Le Roux, Kockott, and Spedding, and with captain Dusautoir getting back to his best, it could be a good campaign for the French. That being said, with the worryingly good form of Ireland, it is possible France will come second in their group, which would pit them against New Zealand in the quarters in a remake of 2011’s final. As I said, unpredictable. One to watch…

## South Africa

Before the recent Autumn Internationals, I had South Africa down as my favourites for the World Cup. They had just beaten New Zealand in the Rugby Championship, and had what seemed like an absolute world class player in Handrè Pollard. However, they seem to have fallen victim to the age old disaster of peaking too early before a World Cup. Their performance, in the same conditions in which the World Cup will be held in less than a year, was disastrous from the same team who had recently beaten the All Blacks. Pollard was playing in the Northern Hemisphere for the first time and it told, as he looked out of his depth playing at an unfamiliar tempo and type of game. Certainly one for the future, but even when they reverted to the more experienced Pat Lambie, they looked short of attacking ideas against Wales, rarely threatening the line. When they return next year they will need leadership, which may be lacking after Jean de Villiers’ shocking injury against Wales which could rule him out of what would be his final World Cup. They still remain my personal favourites though; they will have learnt from this experience and they have an easy group.

## New Zealand

I think I need to say less about New Zealand than I did about France. Their record speaks for itself, losing one game in the last two years. The added pressure of being defending champions could potentially affect their performance, but with the experienced players that they have, it’s unlikely. They will almost certainly reach the Semis, if not the final, and it will take something very special to beat them. But, as South Africa proved, it is certainly possible, and potentially even more so at what promises to be a thrilling World Cup.
