A question oft asked is: ‘what is the greatest sporting event in the world?’ The answer? Obvious. March Madness.

March Madness, an event which captures the focus and imagination of thousands of enlightened minds around the world every March. But March Madness isn’t even an event which professional athletes partake in, I hear you cry, it’s just American college basketball! However, if you believe this, you’re wrong. It is the perfect mixture of passion, talent and promise with a seasoning of massive upsets and titanic battles. The chance for the NBA players of tomorrow to showcase their abilities in front of drooling scouts, hungry for the next LeBron James or Kobe Bryant.
Of course not everyone is familiar with this great sporting spectacle, and why should you be? At the end of the day why should you care about American collegiate basketball? March Madness is the climax of the college basketball season. The top 64 teams from a myriad of different leagues across America come together to compete for the ultimate prize of an NCAA championship. There are 4 seeded divisions and within each division the number 1 seed plays the number 16 and so on. It’s almost like the FA cup on steroids.

As one could imagine, upsets are rife with the minnows of basketball winning David and Goliath-esque games. Players who during the normal season had been unknown quantities are seen suddenly making the plays and hitting the shots for their teams, single-handedly dragging them through the rounds - the round of 32, the sweet 16, the last 8, the final four and at last, the grand finals. For some teams, simply not losing in the first round is greeted with mass excitement by their boozed up college supporters and are treated to a hero’s welcome when they return to school.

Without doubt, this competition is a joy to behold as a spectator, especially if you’re particularly invested in one team’s success. Every year you can fill out the March Madness Bracket Challenge, attempting to successfully predict the winner of every match all the way to the finals before the first game has even begun; a jackpot of millions to be potentially won. It has become increasingly easy to watch these games as well, despite living abroad, as BT sport bought ESPN and thus have the right to broadcast all the games live.

I hope this March as I sit in front of my streaming device at 2 on a Monday morning to watch my beloved Syracuse University Orangemen play, I’ll be comforted by the knowledge that this year I am not alone in enjoying this spectacle. That my fellow students will answer this call and join me in experiencing the rollercoaster of emotions that March Madness inevitably creates. Even if you don’t concur with my claim that you’d be witnessing the greatest event to ever grace this planet, it might just be a nice filler in the gap between the FIFA World Cup and next year’s Rugby World Cup.
