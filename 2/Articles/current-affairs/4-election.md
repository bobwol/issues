## Guide to the Electoral College

Electoral votes are allocated to each state, and the District of Columbia, but not to territorial possessions of the United States such as Guam or Puerto Rico. The number of electors in each state is equal to the number of members of Congress to which the state is entitled. In total, there are 538 electors.

The candidate that receives an absolute majority of electoral votes (in this case 270) for the office of President or of Vice President is elected to that office.

## The Election

The next United States presidential election is scheduled for Tuesday, November 8, 2016. Whilst the incumbent President Barack Obama is not eligible to be elected to a third term, there will be a number of candidates vying for the oval office in January 2017.

## Political Issues

The slow pace of the economic recovery following The Global Financial Crash of 2008 is certain to be the dominant issue in the 2016 election. So, too, will government spending and the national debt, immigration reform and climate change. Of course, too, ever prominent in the campaigns, will be the issues of same-sex marriage, healthcare and gun control.

## The Candidates

The United States is very much a two-party system. The Democrats are considered to be more left wing, whilst the Republicans are right wing.

### The Democrats

The 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries will take place in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories prior to the 2016 general election, in order to determine the Democratic Party's nominee for the Presidency of the United States.

* Joe Biden<br>
Vice President of the U.S. since 2009. He was the U.S. Senator from Delaware from 1973 to 2009, having twice run for president in 1988 and 2008.

* Hillary Clinton<br>
U.S. Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. She was the U.S. Senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, having been a presidential candidate in 2008. A victory would make her the first female president in history.

* Joe Manchin<br>
U.S. Senator from West Virginia since 2010. He was also the governor of West Virginia from 2005 to 2010.

* Martin O'Malley<br>
Governor of Maryland since 2007. He was the Mayor of Baltimore from 1999 to 2007.

Wildcard:

* George Clooney<br>
Actor and filmmaker from California. George Clooney supported Barack Obama's campaign in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, and is a supporter of gay rights.

### The Republicans

The Republican Party presidential primaries, will take place within the Republican Party prior to the 2016 general election. They have planned for the 2016 Republican National Convention to be held in late June of the election year, the earliest since 1948.

* Jeb Bush<br>
Governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007, never before having run for president. If he wins, it would be the first time in history that three successive members of a family would have been president.

* Chris Christie<br>
Governor of New Jersey since 2010. Some political commentators view Christie as a leading contender for the White House, polling at number 2.

* Ted Cruz<br>
U.S. Senator from Texas since 2013. He was the Solicitor General of Texas from 2003 to 2008, and has been associated with the Tea Party, a right-wing liberalist group.

* Paul Ryan<br>
U.S. Representative from Wisconsin since 1999. He was Mitt Romneyâ€™s vice-presidential nominee in 2012.

Wildcard:

* Marco Rubio<br>
U.S. Senator from Florida since 2011. A 2013 poll suggests that Rubio is not disliked by the primary voters, and is vetted as a potential candidate in 2016 by Mitt Romney.

### Third Party Candidates

* Jill Stein (Green Party)<br>
2012 presidential nominee, two-time candidate for Governor of Massachusetts

* Rand Paul (Libertarian Party)<br>
U.S. Senator from Kentucky since 2011

## Swing States

In 48 of the 50 states, the winner of the popular vote in the state wins all of the electoral votes of the state. Hence, recent presidential campaigns have generally focused on competitive states. Potential battleground states include:

* Colorado
* Florida
* Iowa
* Michigan
* New Hampshire
* Nevada
* North Carolina
* Ohio
* Pennsylvania
* Virginia
* Wisconsin

In both the 2008 and 2012 elections, none of these states were able to completely poll positively for either party.
