A few tips for spotting such individuals:

## Scouting Tip 1

Look for the non-regulation jumper. In a brazen attempt to spit in the face of the establishment, the hangster will purchase for a mere £95 a loose-fitting “garm”, of dark red or grey perhaps, with a logo printed on the upper chest. Preferably HUF, although any American designer-skater brand deemed gangster enough will do. The trousers are a giveaway too. Having discarded the School Shop’s in the summer of the 4th Form, the hangster will wear their thigh gap with pride and opt for super skinny jeans or black chinos, matched with limited edition gazelles from the Wavey Garms Facebook group. The haircut is also distinctive; quiff married with accident-involving-a-lawnmower short back and sides.

## Scouting Tip 2

Examine carefully the facial hair. The hangster will often attempt to “cop” some feeble, wispy fur on the upper lip. If questioned on their dubious attempts at stubble, they will respond with something along the lines of not being bothered, and teachers not caring. This muttered response is in fact fabricated to hide the fact they haven’t actually started shaving yet. After this brief interaction the hangster will return his gaze to his phone, where he is busy, casting judgement over the latest Supreme collaboration. He will re-insert his left Beats earphone and continue to listen to his “Jams” playlist, filled by the hardcore raps of Flatbush Zombie, Childish Gambino and Odd Future. This is the only music they can really relate to, and they try to emulate their sick bars and dope lifestyle.

# Survival

Avoidance is unequivocally the best policy. While the hangster remains convinced they are an absolute socialite, they are best left alone in their trust-fund bubble with “the rest of the Lads”, to get drunk off tepid Fosters and smoke their housekeeper’s Marlboros on Wednesday nights. However, should you wish to find a hangster, you need not look far. Boarding the Tube in the morning at Knightsbridge or South Kensington, Hangsters will spend the journey to Hammersmith sipping a caramel macchiato with extra cinnamon sprinkles, reinforcing their bad-boy image. They often congregate in the Tuck Shop at morning break to affirm each other over Drench and croissants that the Maths test “was bulls**t”, and that they do in fact “get bare”. As for lunch break, well - the gym does of course take up a large part. Girls love a hench lad, they will claim- that’s what they heard in the Dapper Laughs documentary anyway. They can be found doing assisted curls and smith machine benches, every day, except leg day, which is customarily skipped in the atrium.  After the “major sesh” they will adjourn to the lunch hall to sip protein and discuss who is making the maddest gains. The hangster group is easy to identify, as they will be the 5 or 6 with matching myprotein.com shaker cups, who when they leave for lessons will bid farewell with the words “aite, man, safe.” Do at this point try your best to suppress the bile rising in your throat.
Should you be landed in a lesson with a hangster, remember: they are more afraid of you than you are of them.
