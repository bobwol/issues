> Dear Erasmus, as a fourth former, when I walk to the illustrious temple of the Broadway, I take pride in wearing my school blazer, my polished shoes and with a wheelie bag in hand. However, now I am being informed by the Daily Mail that the school insists that I must adopt the uniform of the local ‘youths’ which consists of a hoodie and trainers. How can I be seen to be wearing such garments? And where does one even purchase these so called ‘hood-ies’??

I need not emphasise the severity of the dangers of travelling across the bridge in school attire. The Daily Tale itself remarked ‘pupils have to walk across it every day and the muggers wait at either end knowing they have no escape.’ That’s right; you plant a tentative foot on Hammersmith Bridge every day, fully aware that what awaits you at the end is a Braveheart-esque army of ‘local youths’, eyeing your St Paul’s Barmy Army jumper with glee.

On the other hand, social suicide through fashion errors in the Broadway is wholly unacceptable. With a casual hood-ie on, you simply look like someones who goes to… ‘that other school’. A good compromise that has been found so far is the renowned ‘St. Pauls hood-ie’. Purchasable at the school shop or to be found strewn all over Rugby pitches, it allows you to blend in with ‘the local youths’ while still allowing you to pull out the crest at a moments notice while loitering in Starbucks.

> Dear Erasmus, one morning I was affronted by a little man in the atrium insisting that we give too much aid to the poor and that I should follow him to the support of UKIP. Soon things became out of hand, and I found myself in numerous meetings involving rituals I dare not describe for fear of repercussion. All the while the little man was insidiously blaming the country’s issues on the ‘scousers’. How do I avoid this rowdy man? Who do I turn to in order to save myself from this predicament?

Political Extremism is a known enemy in the treacherous corridors of St. Paul’s, and once these radicals have sunk their fangs into your trailing leg, it is admittedly difficult to get out. They will start cropping up everywhere: next to you in the library, opposite to you at lunch, and god-forbid, worst of all… on your Facebook newsfeed. Surrounded you will be, but not without a way out. In fact, so simple is the way out I’m surprised there are still so many of these politicised zombies: simply walk into school one day with an EU badge firmly attached to your lapel and a copy of ‘The New Statesman’ in your arm. So appalled will our little friends be that they will scamper away into the corners of the atrium, ready to pounce on another poor soul.

> Dear Erasmus, recently I had the severe misfortune of participating in the famous tray-drop routine at lunch. If this incident were to repeat itself, should I stand up and take a bow or flee in cowardice?

There are a couple of tell-tale errors which establish yourself as the culprit of the crime. All include heavy blushing, frenetic spasm of the neck muscles and a general stuttering.
The first is the classic ‘I’ll stand here with my arms outstretched staring at one of my friends as if it was their fault’. This obviously is limited in efficacy, as your friend will most likely be laughing at you, or will have planned his escape route and will be well on his way to the safe haven that is the river of sludge, leaving you blushing, trembling, and if anything, attracting attention.
