St Paul’s breeds talent. Passion. Creativity. Whether observed in the 4th choice scrum-half for London Wasps, or in the 3rd best schoolboy mathematician in the UK (still yet to do his (i)GCSEs), quality and dedication ooze from our current crop of Paulines. Many students have gone on from St Paul’s to dominate society as Chancellors of the Exchequer, Olympic Gold Medallists, Editors of The Times and founders of TravelEX Group (a game of guess the OP is definitely on the cards here).

However, not every talent can be celebrated through successes in 3 hour maths papers, on the gilded grass of Bigside, or through Young Enterprise and Student Investor. There has been a vast impact in contemporary culture by pop-folk musicians such as Charlie Fink of Noah and the Whale, Winston Marshall of Mumford and Sons, and freshly signed Archie Faulks, as well as novelists such as Patrick Neate and director Blake Ritson (all OP). OP Alex Barron actually broke the world record for most balls juggled while still at SPS a few years ago, a talent so neglected that he had to film it himself. Surely more should be done by the school to nurture and celebrate current students’ gifts outside the traditional fields of achievement. That being said, the Art and Drama departments must be mentioned here for their emboldening displays of contemporary artwork and theatre, as well as societies such as ImpSoc and The Prestige Society, rejoicing in the comedy and conjuring that Paulines have to offer.

But unless you happen to play either classical or jazz music (which are perfectly valid preferences, don’t get me wrong), good luck being selected to play a school concert. Have fun trying to find an audience for your breakdancing. See how long you can perfect your atrium stand-up before being shooed away by an Undermaster for Period 6. Enjoy the bemused dirty looks while you achieve spiritual unity with your didgeridoo. If only there was some kind of school event where students and teachers alike could showcase their underappreciated talents…

On Thursday 5th February 2015, St Paul’s Got Talent returns to the Wathen Hall, complete with performances from both pupils and staff, celebrity judges, world record attempts, guest performances and show-stopping refreshments. This is for the showmen, the misfits, and the bold. This is the chance to play that song you wrote about that Paulina you stared at for most of the KCS game, to bust those moves that your bedroom mirror has adored for years, to don that best suit and practice some jokes you stole off Sickipedia. Teachers, we want to experience those Oxbridge rock band revivals, hear those tender odes to the M25, witness those wedding dance routines. Dust off that didgeridoo. Your time is now. It’s for charity, for god’s sake.
