One afternoon, around 6 years ago, when I overheard in the lunch hall a certain William Emamian making reference to a plotline from an episode that had aired the night before, I discovered I was not the only person I knew who avidly followed EastEnders. It was a hugely significant moment for me. It was the stark realisation that I was not alone in my bizarre obsession and for one extraordinary moment I began to consider if I should not in fact be embarrassed about it.

Alas, this brief reflection did not prevail and I remained truly ashamed of my hidden passion. EastEnders is not on the radar for most sections of the middle classes. To confess I was a fan was almost as bad as bringing a Tesco “Bag For Life” into Waitrose or turning up at Lord’s without a cheese knife. In truth, this is the first time I’ve really opened up about my interest in the show, although my closest friends have known for some time. It’s provoked some fairly awkward situations in the past: “9? Why can’t we meet earlier?” someone asked me once, unaware of EastEnders’ later scheduling of 8pm on a Friday. How I longed to tell him that iPlayer at 2 in the morning is a dark, lonely place I would be forced to visit if I missed that night’s instalment because of other commitments.

Whether people question my love of the show due to fundamental class divisions or because they just find it fundamentally odd I’m yet to work out. I do confess it is a bit irregular; it’s 2 hours’ worth of content every week and the program is predominantly watched by middle-aged women as opposed to 16-year-old boys. I suppose what I like about EastEnders is that it’s different, it’s an insight into a whole different world, it’s my escape from Bob Howat and work and ImpSoc and parties and whatever and my regular plunge into Albert Square and its on-going turmoil. Yes, the plotlines and the characters may be ridiculous, but I do in fact feel a strange emotional attachment with them and whether it’s that weird time Ian left the show for 2 months and came back randomly as a homeless man or when Tanya and Jack (Max’s brother) tried to bury Max (Tanya’s ex-husband) alive, the events of their absurd lives has a strange impact on mine. It’s a social study, a lifestyle choice and an escape from reality all rolled into one.

When I was performing at the Edinburgh Fringe during the summer, I bumped into an old Pauline on the Royal Mile. Amongst our lengthy conversation, he said something to me that felt rather poignant: “Your 5 years at St Paul’s essentially mould your character for the rest of your life.” If he was right, then not only should you try and get involved in as many different things as you can while you’re here, but you should also take pride in what you enjoy, whatever that may be. Whether you’re one of the fantastic knitting aficionados I recently met at KnitSoc(k), whether you play the triangle in the school orchestra like Oliver Besley, whether you’re Charles Cavalla, unsure if telling a girl you very nearly played darts for your county would be a tactical error, celebrate your eccentric interests and hobbies because ultimately they’ll build your personality and, most importantly of all, you’ll enjoy yourself more. I’ve learnt recently that pretending to be someone you’re not is by far and away the greatest insult anyone can ever give you and it should be avoided at all costs – even if that does mean admitting your love for EastEnders.
