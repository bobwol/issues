I approach the entrance. I’ve long enjoyed dealing with food at home, but now my hobby is a job. I push open the restaurant’s side door. The manager is welcoming. He shakes my hand. Employees are “mate” to him, at least on the rare occasions when English is being spoken. Yet I’m aware that I’m the low-man on the totem pole - no school grades can save me from forgetting a drinks order or serving the wrong table.

My initialisation is swift. I’m shown the table numbers: “This corner - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Here, 7, 8, 9, 10. Over here 11, 12, - 14.” No thirteen though - a decidedly Western superstition. Yet there is still a table four - a number I recall to be associated with death in Chinese culture. I enquire.  Apparently the place was a French restaurant beforehand, and the owner is loath to change things. A “Feng Shui thing”, I’m told.

I've scarcely time to absorb this cultural quirk before one of the staff hands me a cloth - “Clean Windows.” I oblige. I’m then instructed to check on the toilets. Mercifully they’re clean, and I throw out my blue gloves with relief.

I’m shown the evening’s schedule. One booking jumps out- a large 50th birthday party. The host has asked for a very specific seating plan, and we’ve scarcely finished arranging when the first customers arrive. They’re ushered to their seats, and I’m to take their drinks order. I’m going to be learning on the job. I’m paid to be a part of a team after all, not a bystander.

As I return to the serving counter, the birthday group arrives. I had been expecting a Chinese family out for a traditional celebration, but could hardly have been more mistaken. A troupe of old public schoolboys walks in, laughing about rugby. These are the sort of people I see day in and day out. It feels strange to be looking in on this world from outside. They take a seat. To them I’m just a slightly paler face in a swarm of otherwise anonymous staff.  I catch flecks of conversation - something about the Labour party, or some or another boarding school - that I would normally hear from my peers. I even feel like responding when I hear Jeremy Corbyn being discussed. But these aren't my conversations. My job is to bring food, clear plates, bring more food.  

An endless stream flows from the dumbwaiter. The cultural overload is intense, and many things I’m seeing for the first time. The dishes are hastily explained to me - “steamed bamboo cup soup with egg whites and chicken” - and the food is loaded onto round black trays. I make deliveries, then return with empty plates.

The night evaporates under the heat of the rush. There’s a rare break in the scurrying when a birthday cake is brought out - the manager brings it to the table, and we all form a singing procession. Only halfway through the song do we realise we have no idea what name to sing. Fortunately the party is big enough for our mouthing to go unnoticed.

Eventually the restaurant empties, and I glance at my watch - eleven-thirty. I had forgotten that I would be working beyond closing time. Fortunately the kitchen send us up a steaming plate of rice and chicken. I bid my farewells, and sprint home with a takeaway box. Fortunately my dad is still up. He’s curious about how it went. I’m curious if I've been saved any of the family dinner. We talk, and I laugh at some of the old jobs he’s had. Most make mine look like a vacation. I head upstairs and collapse into bed, tired but grateful.  I’ll never see the guys with the black shirts and notepads the same way again.
