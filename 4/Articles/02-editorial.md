To get to this stage has taken a fair bit of work on my part, not to mention the hours put in by my editorial team, Guy on design, the guys who sold this to you, Mr Larlham and The Wizard. I don’t think it’s unfair to suggest that, at 50p, this represents exceptional value and, what’s more, any profits we do manage to muster are going towards the bursary fund. Unless you, I don’t know, hate charity, I’m struggling to see how anyone could criticise how we’ve gone about producing this thing. That aside, I’m also really pleased with the quality of our content in this issue and I hope that you agree. As ever, I’ve tried to ensure there remains a collection of different themes, hopefully appealing to a wide range of people with varying interests. Have a flick through and come to your own conclusion about whether we’ve done a good job. If you do think there are areas we could improve on within this, please do let me know or indeed write and contribute to our next scheduled issue in December - we’re always looking to involve as many people as possible in the production of this, regardless of your year.

Before I go, I would like to quickly thank not just everyone who has worked towards this first issue under my tenure, but also Carl du Jeu and Mr Larlham who originally had the bold idea to put me in charge of Black & White. To be trusted at the helm of one of the school’s most iconic and valued assets is not something I take for granted. I hope I’ll be able to live up to the expectation and create something the school community can be really proud of.
Have a pleasant half term, see you all in December,
Bob Howat
