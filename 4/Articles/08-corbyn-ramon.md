Now a lot of you must be wondering what on earth I am doing supporting a man on the left of the political spectrum having been a member of UKIP (a membership I did not renew for several reasons which I shall come onto). However, there is something about him which has made him completely different from the rest of the politicians in the Westminster bubble. Ignoring the fact that he has won beard of the year a couple of times, it’s the simple reality that he’s normal and someone who can relate to other people’s misfortunes.

UKIP, having been there for two years, looked to me like a libertarian branch of the Conservative party. Hearing members screaming out for smaller government, lower taxes and even decrying the NHS as being wholly ruinous for not being privatised meant I had to leave that mess and return back to my real home. Neo-liberal economics, the crap that got this country into the mess it endured in the first place simply wasn’t for me. That home is the Labour party, which I was a member of when I was 14 before I jumped the ship at 16 to UKIP. I was in UKIP for one reason and one reason only; that was to campaign for a referendum as Miliband’s Labour didn’t want to acknowledge the fact that millions of people were crying for a referendum and even had the audacity to refuse having one in the run up to May. The referendum is here and so I don’t need to be in UKIP and I happily feel I can campaign for Brexit in a party whose policy is to stay in the EU. Labour just like the Conservatives is a broad church. After all according to a poll in the Huff Post, 49% of us Labour grassroots members are euro sceptic. Even though the Parliamentary party are Europhile love ins and refuse to acknowledge us; this will not stop us campaigning with people from all over the spectrum which is what this referendum will be about. That’s not a bad starting point for a grassroots member like me, eager to get involved in the campaigning. Jezza himself is euro sceptic having voted NO in 1975 but has realigned party position to keep the Blairites in line as compromise is important in politics. At the bottom of his heart he detests that organisation and it was very evident of him being the only one to stand up to it in the leadership campaign.

Now I shall get onto the meaty stuff. Renationalising the railways? Sounds like a bloody sensational idea to me. Railway fares are one of the most expensive in Europe and that’s because we are privatised to the core. Even though the very idea of competition is to make companies drive down their prices to attract the most consumers, it’s utterly failed at this with train tickets being total rip-offs. These companies only reinvest 10% of their profits back into the railways. There are a countless number of delays and some train conditions are hopeless. The only obstacle to this genius policy is the EU, whose EU railways directive 1998 stops Corbyn from doing this as they say there must be some sort of competition in the industry.

Furthermore, Jezza proposes we should cut down the welfare bill in a compassionate and sensible way. Not in the way those Tories are doing it, cutting every single disabled man’s disability living allowance.David Cameron clearly has zero emotional capacity. He’s doing it in the name of corporatism as well. I wonder how many people there are who don’t pay their full tax receipts, let alone any tax. We lose £40 billion a year from tax evasion. Avoidance is a whole other issue. This isn’t mad lefty statistics made up for our own laugh and political purposes, its independent fiscal bodies saying this. We don’t need to raise taxes or reduce them; all there needs to be is a stronger and harsher policing of tax payments making sure people pay on time. He also proposes to cut welfare by reducing housing benefit and adding rent control. Housing benefit currently, doesn’t benefit tenants, it goes directly to the pockets of landlords. This is an indirect excuse for them to charge extortionate and wholly unnecessary rents. This isn’t fair. Either you build more housing on Brownfield sites or you cap rent. He proposes both.

For my Jewish and Northern Irish friends, do not worry about Jezza’s foreign policy. There is no way he can implement this, as the Foreign Office is one of the most powerful bodies on the planet. Obama had an anti-Israel agenda going in 2008 and people thought he could change things but was succumbed to higher forces. Same way Corbyn will not achieve what he wants to with regards to foreign policy if he becomes PM as there are so many powerful civil servants there who will simply tie his hands. Not singing the national anthem was quite ill-advised but accusing him of being unpatriotic is also unwise as it's actually him who holds to British values of tolerance and respecting other people’s traditions (except for those who try to radicalise). And besides, we must get ourselves clear on this issue, disliking Israel and disliking Netanyahu’s government are two separate things. Jezza and I dislike the government as it is backed with racial prejudices but have no problem with the state of Israel existing as a nation which I am sure most people would agree with me on. However, as much as I like Jeremy Corbyn, his comments on the IRA and Sinn Fein would have deeply concerned many people including myself but we shouldn’t take his policy as thankfully he wouldn’t stand a chance of implementing them.

In other words, what I am saying is that the man must be given a bloody chance. It has been about time Labour moved on from the red Thatcherism legacy of Tony B liar (pun intended) and Gordon. Maybe we might see the end of centrist politics, the Tories are already moving to the right and the Lib Dem’s who think they can fill this unwanted part of the spectrum have not got a hope of recovering with a leader who abstained on the Gay Marriage Bill and has distressing views on gay people alike.
