It’s been a long time since Popes at their coronations were required to subject themselves to the infamous “sedes stercoraria”, in which a deacon was given the dubitable task of examining the more private parts of the Most Reverend and Eminent Father of Christendom and proclaiming to the people of Rome: “The Holy Father has them!” One can only guess at what he was talking about. In fact, the tradition ended in 1644, at the coronation of Pope Innocent X. But other “traditions” of similarly dubitable origin have lasted until far more recently, culminating in various apologies for priestly behaviour since the reign of John Paul II.   

The Vatican has in recent times suffered what are seen by some as gross injustices, and by others as necessary retribution for crimes of great seriousness. The effects of the sexual abuse scandal, the outing of the papal butler who stole documents belonging to the most recent Pope, Benedict XVI, and allegations relating to Curial impropriety with unspeakable amounts of money have all contributed to a great decline in prestige for an organization responsible for the care of 1.25 billion souls, and to vitriolic attacks not seen since the Reformation.
Further, the trenchant positions of the Church on abortion and gay marriage are widely seen to do it little credit. Yet, amidst what Cardinal Dolan of New York has called a “whirlwind of hate”, crowds flock in their hundreds of thousands to see an old man in possession of a white robe and a beatific smile. These people would also argue that he is in possession of something else which is far more important-tolerance and respect for the lowliest in society, which they see as redolent of the teachings of Jesus himself.

 Many of these people come from areas we would hardly associate with fervent Christianity. Sub-Saharan Africa and the Philippines alone contain more Catholics than all of Western Europe combined, not to mention Latin America, the origin of the present Pope. Yet at a time of decline in religious sensibilities in European nations which have categorically shirked the Church for empiricism and scientific rationalism, it would seem only reasonable for these poorer nations to give their religious feeling up as well, in favour of what Lincoln called in an 1858 polemic- “Lord Greenback, King of the Land of Dollars.” The Great Commoner referred, of course, to money. Crucially, however, they have not. And they ascribe this staying power of the throne of St Peter in a sceptical world to the humility and trustworthiness of the Pope.

 Francesco Bergoglio, now Pope Francis, appears at first glance to be an unlikely candidate for an office which Pope Benedict XV in 1916 called “a combination of devotion to God and a reverence for Machiavelli.” A man of simple tastes and vivid candour, he might be thought better suited to a peaceful nunciature in a receptive, Catholic country than to a job considered to be more difficult to perform than the US Presidency. Against all odds, he has made himself more powerful, some say, than John Paul II, and perhaps the most potent messenger for his faith since St Paul. Why? Not simply because he understands the needs of his billion and a quarter parishioners-but because he “empathises with them”, and because of his “open and activist approach”, says La Repubblica, the conservative Italian newspaper.
Popes used to be stern men of sterner disposition, conservatives by nature and by creed, and aristocratic in lineage. They were also almost exclusively Italian until John Paul II in 1978. Extraordinary as this may seem, defenders in the Curia presented this glaring injustice as a manifestation of the wish of Jesus for the Papacy to be a “Cephas”, or “rock”, which ,as any geography teacher will tell you, is difficult to remove and even harder to erode. This inflexibility translated itself almost by magic into complacency, and this started what Cardinal Jaime Sin of the Philippines in 1982 called “the caustic erosion of the Rock.” Thirty years of endless accusation required not only strong leadership, but also charisma and a certain almost childlike vitality, which the scholarly Benedict XVI seemed to lack. As Lord Macartney said in 1796 of the Qianlong Emperor in China “…a succession of adroit and personable captains in connexion (sic) with their men have contrived… to keep this first rate man o’war (China)…afloat these past hundred years…” This “connection” is central to a relationship between the ruler and the ruled, and it seemed wanting in the Vatican for decades. I would argue that Francis is so popular, unlike the archconservative Pope Julius II (1443-1513) below, because he has restored this connection-as an analogy, his flock is happy in the same way that you might be after your Wi-fi connection is restored at home, allowing you to feel in control. This is the nature of his success.
