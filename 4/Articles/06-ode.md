As our dear readers returned to school at the start of this term they will most certainly have noticed the considerable changes to (and disappearance of certain parts of) the school buildings.

To help you reflect on these momentous alterations, school-life correspondent Nick Maini poeticises the consequences of the ongoing destruction of the changing-rooms :

Ode To Locker 281:

My dearest locker 281,
<br>Soon I fear that you'll be gone -
<br>Ripped out by the masterplan.
<br>An empty wrapper, crumpled can,
<br>All that's left of where you stood,
<br>In your armour made of wood.

The things that you and I have seen
<br>Words can only try to glean:
<br>The changing rooms that were your kingdom
<br>Where rows of lockers, steeped in wisdom,
<br>Carefully guarded our possessions,
<br>Those lockers passed through generations.

My morning pilgrimage to you
<br>To leave my things then use the loo,
<br>Was a routine that I adored
<br>But one, I know, that some abhorred.
<br>Welcomed by the smell of feet,
<br>Embraced by overwhelming heat,
<br>I'd find the bog, and there I'd sit,
<br>Reading graffiti of poetic wit.

At lunchtime chaos would ensue
<br>As many people came anew;
<br>Floods were caused by rowers' wellies
<br>And cries of many hungry bellies,
<br>As fourth formers rushed to the canteen
<br>At half past twelve and two fifteen.
<br>Hench guys, fresh from lifting weights
<br>Mixed and drank up protein shakes.
<br>While sixth formers with untucked shirts
<br>Kicked footballs at you - where it hurts.

On the floor, a Smorgasbord
<br>Of items left behind before:
<br>Socks and shoes, scarves and hats,
<br>Rugby boots and cricket bats,
<br>And in the bin can just be seen
<br>Last year's 'Pauline' magazine.

After school was much the same
<br>When everybody came again.
<br>A crush of bodies shoved and heaved,
<br>Grabbed their bags and tried to leave.
<br>Some hurried to St Hilda's gate
<br>But others had to stay till late
<br>For play rehearsals, rugby selections,
<br>Concerts, lectures or Friday detentions.
<br>And in their haste they quite forgot
<br>That lockers really help a lot:
<br>Protecting belongings throughout the day
<br>While busy students work away.

And where on earth has gone that mound
<br>Of objects left in "Lost and Found"?
<br>Where do we borrow a club shirt for PE
<br>Or a blazer for Whole School Assembly?
<br>If we've lost our Oysters for the bus,
<br>Where's our guardian - where is Gus?

The changing rooms are not the same
<br>And never shall they be again.
