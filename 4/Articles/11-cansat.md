To the majority of the pupils of this school, this word evokes little or even nothing. Few know what Cansat is. Yet, it is one of the most extraordinary school competitions that St Paul’s competes in every year and often with success. A cansat, simply put, is a simulation of a satellite all integrated within a small drinks can.

Teams participating need to complete two missions, a primary mission that is compulsory for all, and a secondary mission where one is allowed to innovate and differentiate itself from the other teams. The task is to be able to install the necessary equipment found in a satellite such as sensors and a power supply within the can. This year, a crack team of aspiring physicists and engineers will attempt to win the advanced category event for a second year in a row after SPS Team Impulse’s resounding victory last year in both the National and European competitions.

SPS’s Team Cyclone hopes to build an autonomous drone that would be capable of measuring the pressure, temperature, humidity of the atmosphere as well as being able to investigate the topography, flora and fauna of the surrounding area using a live feed camera. The team has a formidable pair of leaders in Ashwin Ahuja - the mastermind behind the electronics and software and Benjamin Yass - the guru of mechanical design and structure. The experience of both William Eustace and James Crompton -both part of Team Impulse last year- is certain to be invaluable. Nick Palmer, Daniel Halstead, Phil Fernandes, Monty Evans and Quentin Gueroult complete this team. For more information on Cansat and the team take a look at the website www.teamcycl.one . 5th and 6th formers should definitely participate next year and as William Eustace says although Cansat could be at times ‘physically, mentally, and emotionally draining, it was still (especially with the benefit of hindsight) a tremendously fun experience.’
