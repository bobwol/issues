Black and White managed to secure an exclusive interview with Richard Nartey, an old pauline who left after his GCSEs to join Chelsea Football Club.

**Black & White: Firstly Richard, could you tell us which position you are playing in at the moment and how far you are from Chelsea's first team?**

I’m playing centre back again. There was a time where I would play centre midfield occasionally but I didn't really enjoy it so I moved back to defence. I'm in the youth team now. Above, there is the Under 21s and then the first team. So, technically, one age group separates the youth team from the first team.

**What is your typical daily routine now? Are you still studying AS levels as well as playing football or are you concentrating solely on football?**

My daily routine has changed quite a lot compared to what it was when I was at school. I take the train up to Cobham in the morning at about eight thirty to get in for breakfast at nine. Training then starts at ten thirty and ends at twelve. We usually have a gym session or another training session in the afternoon as well. I then walk back to the place I am staying at, which is only about ten minutes from the training ground, and I do a two hour A level lesson with a tutor. I am doing two A levels at the moment - French and Maths - and I may do another next year depending on how things go.

**Which teacher do you believe would survive best in the Chelsea FC environment and why?**

It would definitely have to be either Mr Fraser or Mr Rowat. They both know a lot about football and the different aspects of the game.

**Now in all honesty please, what would be the scoreline between SPS 1st XI vs your team in a full ninety minute match?**

It would probably be rather high regardless of whether I was playing or even who I was playing for. The youth team at Chelsea has a lot of very good players in the year above me that do not even train with the youth team anymore and are now either with the Under 21s and some with the first team. However I could see the SPS XI potentially scoring a goal.

**Did you always want to go to Chelsea?**

I have been at Chelsea since I was 8 years old so I never really had to think about that.I was happy playing for my Sunday team at that age and had no idea that I would be playing for Chelsea later on. Although if someone would have asked me who I would want to play for, it would have been Chelsea as I supported them before I got asked to play for them.

**Is it possible you could be transferred away from Chelsea?**

Anything could happen in the future regarding who I am playing for, but I don't think I can say much more than that.

**Is there anyone in the U17 year group who has been offered a professional contract?**

Yes, one person has been offered one and he has signed it recently. Although the club usually waits until next year before it starts handing out the bigger contracts.

**Thinking more specifically about SPS, what was your best memory at St Paul’s?**

I don't have a best memory from my time at St. Paul's but I definitely have a large number of good ones. The very first day of being a Pauline and no longer a Coletine is definitely one of them. Then of course the numerous victories for the school in both rugby and football, and being able to represent the 1st XI last year was great as well.

**What was your worst?**

My worst moment would definitely have to be when I broke my leg in the 4th form during a rugby match. Not only was it extremely painful but it also meant that I wasn't able to play any form of sports at school or Chelsea for 6 months, those were the most difficult months of my life.

**If you could change something at SPS what would it be?**

If I could change something at St Paul's it would have to be the sports facilities, as they are often flooded and waterlogged. The pitches seemed to contain more mud than grass a lot of the time.

**As a final question, if Paulines want to come and watch you play, where can they go?**

It's not really possible. The security will not let anyone without a ticket which is handed out by the club to specific people only.

**Thank you very much for your time Richard, we wish you the best for the future.**
