During his time at St Paul’s, Mr Avni taught in both the Physics and Electronics department, coached tennis, followed the American Football Monday Activity closely and was a university adviser for engineering. His eclectic interests left a resounding impact on the school, and reflect his tireless work ethic and desire to contribute to the atmosphere of St Paul’s in any way. Whether he was talking about Costa or capacitance, his enthusiasm for and love of teaching was clear.
Mr Avni was known for many things. Most Paulines knew his impeccable notes better than the man himself. Many times has a deal been struck in a corner of the atrium for a freshly printed copy of his succinct, yet detailed key to exam success. However, to those that had the good fortune to be taught by him or know him well, Mr Avni will be remembered for his passion and commitment to teaching and his love of Chelsea FC, not to mention his encyclopaedic knowledge of the events surrounding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Indeed, the premature loss of such an inspiring teacher and kind person has hurt the school dearly. He will be sorely missed, but never forgotten.
